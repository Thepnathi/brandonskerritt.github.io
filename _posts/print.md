1. Tell me about yourself
>I'm a computer information student at the university of Liverpool, having just gotten 90%'s in my first semester exams I am aiming to achieve a first overall.
>
> Before university I was at college studying a level 4 HNC in computing and systems development. Whilest at college I became the Student Union's Higher Education Vice President where I increased student satisfaction ratings from around 35% to around 90%.

> In my spare time I write technical blog posts on a range of topics from how Tor works to how Search Engines work at an indepth level. My blog has managed to amass more than 8000 monthly readers. I also work on programming side projects such as a first aid chatbot for Facebook, implementing Capital One into Alexa and more. Some of these projects have even won prizes at hackathons.
>
> If you want to know anything else, feel free to ask me.

3. What are your greatest strengths?

>"I'm an extremely hard worker. I often don't pick up many projects but when I do I go all in. Recently I've picked up blogging, managing to amass more than 8000 monthly readers in less than 5 months. Another proof is the fact that my average grade for my first semester exams laid around 90%.

> I love learning more than anything. I'll read countless books or blog posts or watch videos on topics ranging from computer science to the democratic republic of the kongo. I just feel like there is so much to learn, to help enhance my learning I have started to teach people topics using my blog.

4. What are your greatest weaknesses?

>"I used to be terrified of phone calls. The idea of phoning someone was a no go for me. Having worked in a students union and at multiple events it was inevtiable for me to phone people so I've gotten use to it. I'm still overcoming this but I'm not as bad as I was a year or two ago. I believe this won't be a problem at this company because I'm passionate for the cause of this company which would allow me to talk more on the phone to people revoling around this company, as proven by the numerous phone calls I've had from the recruitment team. That's one of the reasons I want to join this company, because I get to do what I love and I get to push my bounadries and get out of my comfort zone, to grow both personally and professionally."

7. Where do you see yourself in five years’ time?

> Hopefully having started to change the world. I don't know enough about this role, but I aim to continue working for this company as a graduate and perhaps in 5 years time I would have liked to learnt enough to be able to train people and help them in future roles, to really make a difference to this world.

9. What have you achieved in other roles?
z
> My role as Higher Education Vice President started off on a bad turn. There were supposed to be 5 student union officers, but only I wanted to do the job. Effectively leaving me in charge of the work of 5 people, all whilest the student union staff who work with us had left to go to another job.
>
> Luckily this was perfect for me, as I stepped up when no one else would. I travelled to every campus as much as possible to make sure all students were listened to. When a group of students came to me telling me that their course isn't being properly funded I demanded a meeting with the principle of East Kent College to fix this.
>
> As well as this I repeatedly represented the students in a democratic way at both a local (Kent) way and in a national way. I was chosen to attend the National Union of Student's National Confernece, where I elected the next NUS officer team and chose to represent my college on a national scale.
>
> By the end of the year the students were asked to fill out a survey about their time at college. Student union approval ratings were previously laying around 30%, with about 5 questions about the student's union. By the time I finished, it laid around 90% with comments from students saying about how amazing it was for their problems to be fixed so easily.
> 
> On top of this, I received a letter from the Chief Executive President of Student Welfare saying that I was the best Student Union's Officer ever and rewarding me with a £50 Amazon voucher.

10. Why should we hire you?

> Firstly, I'm an extremely fast learner. This is demonstrated by my awards from hackathons, where I'm usually put in a team using a language I do not know to use an API I do not know in order to create a program which I have never made anything similar for before.
> Secondly,I feel like I have a bigger role to fufill in society. Coming from a not so nice background, I want to change the world. I want to enable people to easily learn whatever they want, I want to keep everyone safe from these new complicated viruses and cyber security threats.

11. Why do you want this job?

12. Have you ever done anything related to cyber security before?

A few years ago I was in a cafe and asked for the Wi-Fi password. The password given to me was for the cafe's home network. A quick NMAP scan showed that they had their personal devices on this personal network and they were giving out their wifi password to anyone who asked. I wrote a letter to the business explaining how this is bad and explained how they could fix it. I never went back but I would like to assume they fixed the issue.
