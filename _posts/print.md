1. Tell me about yourself
>I'm a computer science student at the university of liverpool aiming to get a first class degree, previously studying computing at a local college.
>
>While at college I became the student union's higher education vice president. During this role I ran the collective college partnership's Student Union consisting of 5 colleges. Towards the end of my role the annual student survey was completed and every section for the student union, most noticably the student union satisfaction and representation area went up from 30% to around ~85%. The skills I learnt were to be an effecticve team player, to communicate complicated ideas to board members in meetings, interviewing skills and how to deal with deadlines which i believe will help me in this position during work.
> If there is anything else you would like to know, feel free to ask me.

3. What are your greatest strengths?

>"I'm an extremely hard worker. I often don't pick up many projects but when I do I go all in. Recently I've picked up blogging, managing to amass more than 8000 monthly readers in less than 5 months. Another proof is the fact that my average grade for my first semester exams laid around 90%.

4. What are your greatest weaknesses?

>"I used to be terrified of phone calls. The idea of phoning someone was a no go for me. Having worked in a students union and at multiple events it was inevtiable for me to phone people so I've gotten use to it. I'm still overcoming this but I'm not as bad as I was a year or two ago. I believe this won't be a problem at this company because I'm passionate for the cause of this company which would allow me to talk more on the phone to people revoling around this company, as proven by the numerous phone calls I've had from the recruitment team. That's one of the reasons I want to join this company, because I get to do what I love and I get to push my bounadries and get out of my comfort zone, to grow both personally and professionally."
