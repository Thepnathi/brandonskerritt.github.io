# Question 1

Starting from the base of a hill, a car drives (in a straight line) to the end of a road located at its summit. If the starting position of the car is defined by the coordinate <70, 10> and the hill peak (where the road ends) has coordinates <95, 60>, what is the **gradient** of the hill?

- 1
- 2
- 4
- 8
- 16

## Answer

The gradience is defined by the formula:

$$\frac{change \space in \space Y}{change \space in \space X}$$

So this formula is really just:

$$\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

And given the 2 vectors:

$$ <70, 10> \space <95, 60>$$

then we simply take the y values which are:

$$ y_1 = 10 \space y_2 = 60$$

and the x values which are:

$$ x_1 = 70 \space x_2 = 95$$

then the formula is:

$$\frac{60 - 10}{95 - 70} = \frac{50}{25} = 2$$

So the **gradient** is 2.

You **do not** need to memorise this formula. It is given to you in the exam. **Do not memorise this formula**.

# Question 2

When the vehicle has climbed up to a height of 50 metres on the hill (i.e. y = 50) what is the **horizontal** distance that has been travelled at this point (i.e. the corresponding value of x)?

- 82 metres
- 84 metres
- 86 metres
- 88 metres
- 90 metres

## Answers

So in the first question we found out that they started at <70, 10> and then they vertically travel 50 metres. The final destination is <95, 60>. The current coordinate when they travel 50 metres up is <x, 50>. 

The gradient stays the same.

$$ \frac{60 - 50}{95 - x}$$

The 60 and 50 are the:

$$y_2 - y_1$$

the 95 and x are the :

$$x_2 - x_1$$

But since we know the gradience is 2 and we are using the gradience formula we know that this equation must be equal to 2 (since the gradience does not change):

$$ \frac{60 - 50}{95 - x} = 2$$

And then some simple algebraic manipulation gets us:

$$ \frac{10}{95 - x} = 2$$
$$ 10 = 2(95 - x)$$
$$ 10 = 190 -2x$$
$$ -180 = -2x$$
$$ 180 = 2x$$
$$\frac{180}{2} = x$$
$$90 = x$$
$$ x = 90$$

So the coordinate when it is 50 metres up is:

$$ <90, 50>$$

# Question 3

The following question refers to the setting described below.

An essay marking scheme is revised so that + grades can be given. Now the **ordered** range of grades is:

$$ <G, G+, F, F+, E, E+, D, D+, C, C+, B, B+, A>$$

These are converted to **basic** marks ranging from 0 (for G) through to 6 (for A) but with + grades scored 0.5 more than the grade which the + qualfiies for (eg F+ is 1.5, C+ is 4.5 and so on).

At the same time a new formula to convert **basic** marks (in the range 0 to 6) to **final** marks is adopted. This is the formula $$RevisedMarkScheme(x)$$ in which:

$$RevisedMarkScheme(x) = 2x^3 - 18x^2 + 30x + 40$$

What **grade** does an essay need to be awared to achieve the **maximum** possible **final** mark?

* A
* C+
* D
* F
* G

## Answer

The terms **maximum** and **minimum** come from turning points in calculus.


# Question 9

Consider the **three** $$ 4 x 4$$ matrices, **P**, **Q**, and **R** below:

$$ P = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 0 & 3\\\ 1 & 4 & 0 & 6 \\\ 1 & 6 & 0 & 9 \\\ 1 & 8 & 0 & 12\end{pmatrix}$$

$$ Q = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\ 2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\ 3 & 6 & 9 & 12\end{pmatrix}$$

$$ R = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\ 2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\\ 5 & 5 & 5 & 5\end{pmatrix}$$

* P only
* Q only
* R only
* P and Q only
* All three matrices are singular

## Answer

So anytime you see a row / column of 0's in a matrix it's singular unless the 0's look like this:

$$ R = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\ 1 & 0 & 3 & 4 \\\ 2 & 4 & 0 & 8 \\\ 5 & 5 & 5 & 0\end{pmatrix}$$
