```

Predict the next working set using the principle of locality rule for the set W(10, 3)

### Question 2

```

```

What is the working set expressed as W(3, 4).

## Answers
### Question 1

W(t - s, s) = W(10 - 3, 3) = W(7, 3) = {r, r, q} = {r, q}

### Question 3

The working set of a process is defined to be the set of resources (T, s) defined in the time interval [T, T+s].

W(3, 4) = W(3, 3 + 4) = W(3, 7) = {q, q, q, p} = {q, p}
