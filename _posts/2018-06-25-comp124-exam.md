### Question 15 
```
Consider the following situation regarding two processes (A and B), and two resources (X and Y):
-  Process A is granted resource X and then requests resource Y.
- Process B is granted resource Y and then requests resource X.

Which of the following is (are) true about the potential for deadlock?
I.  Deadlock can be avoided by sharing resource Y between the two processes
II.  Deadlock can be avoided by taking resource X away from process A
III.  Deadlock can be avoided by process B voluntarily giving up its control of resource Y
``` 
* a)  I only
* b)  I and II only
* c)  I and III only
* d)  II and III only
* e)  I, II and III

### Question 16 
```
Given the CPU burst times of the processes, we know what their individual wait times will be:
–  0 milliseconds for P1 –  13 milliseconds for P2 –  18 milliseconds for P3
Thus, the average wait time will be (0 + 13 + 18)/3 = 10.3 milliseconds
```
What will the average wait time change to if the processes arrived in the order P2, P3, P1?

### Question 17
```
•  The wait times for each process are as follows:
•  3 milliseconds for P1
•  14 milliseconds for P2
•  8 milliseconds for P3
•  0 milliseconds for P4
```
What would the average wait time be if we had been using the First Come, First Served algorithm?

## Answers
### Question 1

W(t - s, s) = W(10 - 3, 3) = W(7, 3) = {r, r, q} = {r, q}

### Question 2

The working set of a process is defined to be the set of resources (T, s) defined in the time interval [T, T+s].

W(3, 4) = W(3, 3 + 4) = W(3, 7) = {q, q, q, p} = {q, p} 

### Question 3 
Answer: c
* Runs sequentially. A has to finish running before B starts
* With multiprogramming, I/O for one process can take pave whilst the computation takes place for another. Therefore 3 is true

### Question 4
Answer: d
Only one program (ls) is involved, but this will be run as two pocesses.

### Question 5
Answer: b
The shell calls fork(); the child process calls exec() and the parent calls wait(). The shell is just another process that can take a string as standard input, look for the program referenced by the string, and then run this program. Unless the program is put in the background, the shell will wait until the program has finished.

### Question 6 
Answer: c
The parent process will be moved back to the ready state (depending on the scheduling policy), and once the child has been admitted, will also be placed in the ready state

### Question 7 
Answer: d
Blocked; it may take some time before the file system can read the file (e.g. on a networked file store), so the process is blocked until the data is available.

### Question 8 
Answer: c
Only line 10 will be passed to wc -w

### Question 9
Answer: a
u*t; a/2; and t*t – i.e. only those parts of the formula that have no dependencies on other parts of the formula can be run concurrently. Think how the formula could be written in 3-code...

### Question 10 
Answer: a
Every Java program starts as a thread! The rest of the statements are true...

### Question 11
Answer: b
If T1 executes first, then it acquires the semaphore, which is immediately released by T2. Both then execute the critical region.
If T2 executes first, it releases a semaphore it does not have, which can be acquired by T1. Again, both can execute the critical region.

### Question 12 

We have to ensure the following (problems with synchronsization):
–  producer cannot put items in buffer if it is full
–  consumer cannot extract items from buffer if it is empty
–  buffer is not accessed by two threads simultaneously 

### Question 13

*  Two threads can still access the buffer simultaneously – there is nothing to stop this
* Note: The problem gets even worse when there are several consumers and producers

### Question 14
* Deadlock can arise
* If the consumer tries to remove an item from an empty buffer, it will *ve to wait for the buffer to be filled by the producer
* But the buffer will not be filled as the consumer has the lock
* Similarly for the producer

### Question1 15 
Answer: e
I, II and III – as all three options will avoid exclusive ownership of the resources.

### Question 16
*  P2 with CPU burst of 5 milliseconds
*  P3 with CPU burst of 1 millisecond
*  P1 with CPU burst of 13 milliseconds
 Thus, the average wait time will be (0 + 5 + 6)/3 = 3.7 milliseconds

### Question 17
(0 + 5 + 14 + 20)/4 = 9.75 milliseconds
