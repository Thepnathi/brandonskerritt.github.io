# Functions
We've all seen what a function looks like. Any function can be plotted onto a graph as a line.

# Function of a line
To work out the function of a line you need to find out how steep the line is, y, and find out what poitn should be on the line when x = 0, c.

This gives us the formula:

$$ y = mx + c $$

## Gradience

We can find the gradient using this formula:

$$ \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$

Or in other words

How much Y should change relative to how much X has changed.

## Finding the offset

So we already know some facts:

<0, c> is on the line but we don't know where
$$ <x_1, y_1,> $$ is on the line

We know line has gradient M

We know this gradient does not change, as it is a line.

So the gradient from <0, c> to <x1, y1> is the same as the gradient from <x1, y1> to <x2, y2>

In other words, C must be (when x = 0)

$$ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{y_1 - c}{x_1 - 0} $$

# Weird looking graphs

Let's say you have a graph that looks like this:

![img](https://screenshotscdn.firefoxusercontent.com/images/b3361b72-31d7-491a-bd79-188cff7ea1e9.png)

How do you calculate the line function of that graph?

We start with some function, we'll call it F(x)

We choose to places, x = a and x = b and find the values of F(a) and F(b)

Then we use the line connecting <a, F(a)> to <b, F(b)> to "reason about" F(x). 

If we use this method we can approximate lines like so:

The line joining <−10,F(−10)> to <5,F(5)> doesn’t seem to tell us much about F(x).

Well, that's a bit rubbish isn't it?

The line doesn't tell us anything about the function.

What we're seeking is how F(x) (the curve) behaves as a line when it x = 5.

The “closer” <x,x2> is to <5,25> the “better” the quality of information the line between the two points provides about the gradient of the “line touching” the curve at <5,25>. But we cannot use the line from <5,25> to <5,25> itself because if you attempt to calculate the gradient of this line the gradient will be 0.


We want to know what’s going on at the point <5,25>. We look at the line between <5,25> and <x,x2> with x getting “close to” 5: That is, set x= 5 +d and let d become “very very small”.[In general for a point $$<x,x^2>$$ we look at points $$<x+d,(x+d)^2>$$].

In other words, we take the original equation and we multiply each component by d (but we do not let d = 0) so the second equation gets "closer and closer to" the original without them ever becoming the same equation.

We do this because we cannot reason the equation of a graph that looks like $$X^2$$. Okay, professional hat off. We cannot reason the equation of some whacky out of this world graph with lines going which way and every where all at once, so we use a normal line to attempt to represent these weird looking graphs. 

# Now we want to find a gradient

We want to find the gradient of the line joining <5, 25> to $$<5 + d, (5 + d)^2>$$. Earlier we learnt that for any 2 points in a plane (the graph) there exists a unique line connecting these 2 points and the line $$<5 + d, (5 + d)^2>$$ is a point that is ever so close to the original point.

$$\frac{(5+d)^2 - 25}{5 + d - 5} = \frac{(5+d)^2}{d}$$

And with a bit of rearranging we get

$$\frac{(5+d)^2 - 25}{d} = \frac{25 + 10d + d^2 - 25}{d} = 10 + d$$

So we know that the nearer d gets to 0, the nearer the line gets to 10. This is simply seen in the equation $$10 + d$$. If d was 1, the line would be at 11. But obviously d is very very small. Minute, almost. If d gets smaller and smaller than the line touching the curve gets closer and closer.

Let's try another example.

Let's say we have 2 points:

$$<x+d, (x+d)^2>$ and $x, x^2$$.

The gradient formula for any line is

$$m = \frac{change in y}{change in x}$$

And we know for a fact that there is always a unique line between 2 points.

Then we can use the gradient formula to work it out.

$$\frac{(x+d)^2 - x^2}{x+d - x} = \frac{x^2 + 2xd + d^2 - x^2}{d} = {2xd + d^2}{d} = 2x + d $$

The gradient of the line touching $$<x, x^2>$$ on the curve $$ y = x^2$$ approaches the value 2x, but it never becomes 2x because of the value d (where d can never be 0). The idea is to learn something about a curve by creating a straight line that gets ever so slightly close to a point on the curve without ever touching the exact point on the curve. 

We do this because it's easier to reason about straight lines than it is to reason about curved lines.

I highly suggest taking the two points and trying to find the gradient yourself using the formula 

$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

# Limits
The gradient of the line touching the point $$<x,x^2>$$ on the curve $$f(x) = x^2$$ is ‘best described by’ the value of the function f(x) = 2x

Or in other words:

$$\lim_{d \to 0} \frac{(x+d)^2 - x^2}{d} = 2x$$

The term $$\lim_{d \to 0$$ is just like our notation of choosing a point $$<x+d, (x+d)^2>$$ "closer and closer" to our original point $$<x, x^2>$$. Letting d become as close to (without reaching) 0.

This is referred to as a "limit".

# Differentiating Functions

For a function the notion of:
> "the function for the gradient of the line touching the point <x, f(x)>"
is referred to as the *first derivative* of the function f(x).

So previously we have seen how to calculate the gradient of a line with 2 points, but now we want to calculate the gradient of a line touching an x coordinate that is also touching the line function f(x).

The formula to calculate that f'(x)=2x for $$f(x) = x^2$$ can be rewritten to be used by any function like so:

$$f'(x) = \lim_{d \to 0} \frac{f(x+d) - f(x)}{d}$$

If you look, you'll notice it's very very similar to what we were playing with earlier.
