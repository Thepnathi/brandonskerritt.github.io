# Question 1

What type of number is used to count the number of individuals living at a specified address?

## Answer

Natural numbers. The question here says individualS. Implying there is more than 1 person. So we start counting at 1. Natural numbers allow us to count from 1.

If it were possible for 0 people to live at the address then it would be whole numbers.

# Question 2

What type of number is used to count the number of children (defined as anyone under 16) living at an address?

## Answer

Whole numbers. Since it's possible no children live at an address.

# Question 3

What is the coefficient of $$x^0$$ in this formula?

$$f(x) = (x - 4)( x - 5)(x - 6)$$

## Answer

So $$x^0$$ is the same as saying "what is the number that is all on its own,  with no x value?".

Any number multiplied by $$x^0$$ is just the number.

$$ 12x^0 = 12$$.

So this is asking us "what is the number we get when we multiply out all the brackets?"

Since we specifically know we only want the singular number, we can ignore all x values and just multiply these together:

$$ -4 * -5 * -6 = -120$$

If you forget about this, you can just multiply out all the brackets.

Here's a good BBC article on it.
