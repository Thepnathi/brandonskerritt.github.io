So I got really sick and tired of seeing "How to get the perfect job" and then them only giving you like 3 paragraphs and saying "buy my book or sign up to my email list to get the rest XDDDDDDD" so I'm releasing all the information I've learnt from these scam artists for free.

Also I'm really sick and tired of Medium articles that are 5 - 7 minutes long and they talk about how amazing the author is and then they release a single sentence of information that's useful. So this is a no-thrills no-handrails guide to jobs.

# CV

## Personalise your CV

Seriously, customise your CV per job. Don't send the same CV out to many jobs. Think about what you've done that's important to the job.

Customising your CV enables you to pass the keyword test.

When you apply for a job, most jobs will read your CV to see if it contains certain keywords. If it doesn't, no job for you. This is either done by a human, which is a little forgiving or a machine which doesn't care about you.

Your CV will impress the person reading it if its customised to them. Everyone likes a customised birthday cake more than a regular Tesco own brand birthday cake.

To customise your CV analyse the job description. Read it multiple times and highlight keywords that come up. They say that they want someone with strong self motivation? Find something you've done that proves this and put it onto your CV.

Read the job description, the responsibilities, the specific requirements, the location. Any words you don't know? They're probably keywords. Google them.

Let's say a job description has this sentence in it:

> Required - Advance knowledge of Microsoft Applications (Word, Excel, Powerpoint).

Then instead of writing "Microsoft office" on your CV you write:

> Advance knowledge of Microsoft Software (Word, Excel, Powerpoint).

## Lie about your location

Want to get a job in London? Then write "London" on your CV. No company wants to worry about someone commuting from Kent every day. They don't have to know.

But make sure it's not too much of a lie. Saying you live in London when you're from Skegness or St. Ives is a blatant lie.

## Writing a CV

Make it 1 page. If you customise your CV per job, you should only ever need 1 page. If you have 20+ years of experience, 2 pages is okay, but 1 page is preferable.

Use a CV template and fill it out.

If you know a little tiny bit about computers you can Google "LaTeX CV templates" to get some really nice templates for free. If it's on Overleaf or ShareLaTeX than good. LaTeX is basically like a programming language but for writing.

List your achievements at a job, not the duties you had to do.

Avoid spelling and grammar mistakes at all costs. Pay someone to read over it if you have to. Message me if you need help with this. I'm not an expert at spell checking, but I can be another pair of eyes.

Don't fill it chock full of information. Keep it short and sweet.

Use numbers. In the UK we have this English writing rule:

>A FOREST. A Alliteration F Facts O Opinion R Repetition / Rhetorical questions E Emotive language S Statistics T Triples (Three, rule of) 

The statistics is important here. If I was to say that I was the best Student Union officer that would make me sound big headed. If I was to change that to "changed Student Union approval rating from 30% to 90%" it would sound even more impressive and not so egotistical.

Make sure to give your CV in PDF format, unless they explicitly ask for a different format.

If they require the CV in plaintext (copy and paste) you have to format it differently. You can make sections using "----". Like so:

```
Achievements
------------
Changed Student Union approval rating from 30% to 90%
```

## Make it as easy for your employer as possible

Really think about who you are applying to. If you're applying in the tech industry chances are that they reading your CV on a computer, so hyperlinks in CVs are really cool. If not, maybe don't include them as they don't look good when printed out.

## Use a template

I cannot stress this enough. There are hundreds, if not thousands of amazing CV templates online. Just Google "CV Template" and you'll find one.

## Please just customise it for your job

If you're applying for a job that requires programming, have a "languages" section on your CV that talks about all the languages you know.

Most people fire off blankets of CV's to every single recruiter on their LinkedIn like North Korea launching nukes without ever customising it. Do not do this.

## Have a "profile" section

This profile is a small section of your CV that includes a brief summary of your skills, experiences and goals. It is your elevator pitch.

It really is customised to you. I can't tell you what to write. You can find examples of profiles in the example CV section.

## Bullet Points in a CV

Do not write paragraphs. Have bullet points instead.

For any past work or experience you will want to include accomplishments at this job that relate to the job you are applying to.

Try not to include your duties. It's much more impressive to show your accomplishments.

In your bullet points use action verbs. These are words like "accomplished", "designed", "initiated", "supervised".

## Things to include in a CV

Let's say you have a template and you want to change a few few things, here are some things you might want to include:

* Personal details - Telephone, professional email, location - Name
* Work experience
* Achievements
* Education
* Hobbies and interests that relate to the job
* Key skills relating to the job
* Know any languages that relate to the job? Put them down!

What not to include:
* A head-shot / image of you. Unless the company specifies that they require this, do not do this. Unless you are Alex Turner or Emma Watson they do not want to see you.
* Age and date of birth - It's illegal for employers to ask about your age under the Equality Act of 2010.
* Martial / Relationship status - Again under the Equality Act of 2010 they cannot ask this.

Note: The Equality act is a UK act. I'm not sure about the US, but you probably don't want to include them anyway.

Depending on your work and education, you'll need to balance these correctly. Do you have a really good education but not much work experience? Make your education 60% of your CV. Do you have lots of work experience but not much education? Make that 60% of your CV.

What if you have both? Well, just list your education shortly and have your work experience.

How do you list education shortly? Just include the modules that sound the most impressive, try to limit it to 4 maximum along with your grades and university name. Or, again, personalise it. You're applying for a job that involves Artifical Intelligence? Include the modules you've done in this.

Employers find work experience more impressive than academia. Unless you're applying for a job in academia.

## Examples

Here are some examples of CVs. This is my CV

And this is Chris's CV

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rIBsYaRf6qSg9wND32cw4WAAbCBHG0W2/view

TK maybe have photos

# Email

You need a professional email address.

Make it your name, don't use Yahoo or AOL for tech jobs. If you apply to Google with an AOL email address they'll just laugh at you.

Make sure you think about this carefully. I have 2 email addresses, a Gmail one that has numbers on the end of it and a Proton mail one that's just my name. 

The Proton mail one is for tech companies. They might see I use Proton and subconsciously like me based on the fact that I support encryption.

If your email address looks like "FancyMonkey6969@tiscali.com" you need to change this.

# Personal Brand

Everyone has a personal brand, but it's up to you to decide when to take control of your personal brand.

A majority of your posts on social media should be about what you love, but don't make it too fake. Only posting tech stuff / stuff related to your industry makes you seem boring to work with. I genuinely love dogs so much, so I often post adorable dog pictures on my Twitter or pictures / things related to martial arts but I also post alot about technology.

## Create some content

Whether this is writing blog posts, tweeting super nifty tricks you've learnt, weighing in on a converstation on Twitter or contributing to open source software.

The more you create, the more people will care about you. No one cares about you unless you can make them smarter or do something for them.

## LinkedIn

Get a LinkedIn account. Make sure it's professional. Have a nice headshot photograph.

Here's a good LinkedIn inforgraphic from [here](https://www.leisurejobs.com/getasset/7a3e4167-6675-4ae3-be01-6ff723b80f2a/).

## Meet Pauline - A Case Study

Pauline is a powerhouse and the queen of personal branding. She's an amazing example at how to build a personal brand.

### Twitter

https://twitter.com/paulienuh

Pauline is VERY active on Twitter. She regularly posts professionally about her life, and only ever positive things, or in her words, "pawsitive".

She uses her own hashtaghs such as "#Pawgainz".

Pauline has a professional twitter username, a nice coverphoto explaining exactly what she does and what she's all about and a nice profile picture.

Her bio neatly sums up all of her jobs and the things she likes. Her location displays where she's from and where she lives. 

She regularly tweets about things she is passionate about and makes sure to tag and hashtag appropriately. 

With Twitter it's important to hashtag correctly. Try to meld your hashtags into your text so it's readable. Don't just dump them all at the end of a tweet to try and gain peoples attention. Take for example, Pauline's tweet here:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/ShfWit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ShfWit</a>! Happy to see a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WiT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WiT</a> group in Sheffield - thanks for starting a conversation locally ♥️<br><br>At <a href="https://twitter.com/sheffielduni?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@sheffielduni</a> we&#39;ve created a student WiT community with ladies that have taken part in <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeFirstGirls?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CodeFirstGirls</a>: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/shefcodefirst?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#shefcodefirst</a>. 💖 Should definitely collaborate in some way! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShfWIT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ShfWIT</a></p>&mdash; Pauline P. Narvas (@paulienuh) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulienuh/status/975085689682448384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Notice how when she talks about a company, she tags them in it and when she talks about a community or something she hashtags it in. Notice how it reads so cleanly. Now look at this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="nl" dir="ltr">Snapchat UI developer team:)<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gaming?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#gaming</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gamedev?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#gamedev</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/drones?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#drones</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VR</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tech?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#tech</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/code?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#code</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/anime?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#anime</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/STEM?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#STEM</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AR</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DevOps?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DevOps</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AI</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CSS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CSS</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/spotify?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#spotify</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/design?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#design</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iTunes?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#iTunes</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Python?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Python</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/snap?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#snap</a> <a href="https://t.co/CQBFZFjdwE">pic.twitter.com/CQBFZFjdwE</a></p>&mdash; PitchCrunch (@PitchCrunch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PitchCrunch/status/975104344482705409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

![img](https://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/too-much.gif)

Sorry if you're PitchCrunch but the way this hashtagging is done makes it look like a bunch of 50 year olds sat around a table in an office at a Social Media Stratergy and Marketting meeting to discuss the exact hashtags they'll use to "maximise" their outreach without ever using social media properly.

PS: It took me 2 seconds to find this tweet. Steps to reproduce:
1. Type a tech buzzword into Twitter as a hashtag, like #AI or #Python
2. Go to "recent tweets"
3. Click first tweet and there is a 85% chance it will look exactly like this

## Pauline's Blog

Pauline has a blog. 

https://pawlean.com/

Her blog is 10 years old this year. But don't worry, you don't need to have been writing that long. Pauline writes about pretty much everything from love to how her months go to events she goes to.

Here's how she describes it:

"[PAWLEAN]...is a personal blog where I share and reflect on my life in the UK, my interests and experiences. I've run a blog since the days I used to wear my hair up in high bunches (like Boo from Monsters Inc) and during the time in my life when my purple Game Boy Advance completed me. "

Not every one needs to have blogs. But it's important to create some kind of content. As a developer you can work in open source by either directly changing code, opening issues or by writing blog posts.

One of my friends answers Quora questions as a way to create content.

Some other friends make software.

Honestly, as long as you're providing value they will come.

## Instagram

Pauline also has a pretty professional instagram, with a professional username too.

Her bio says:

>⚡️ .🐾💪🏻{ 📌🇬🇧 · 🏠🇵🇭🇪🇸; 👩🏻‍🔬 BMS @ TUoS; 👩🏻‍💻 Dev · PaulineNarvas.com; 🎬 YouTube.com/PaulineNarvas; 🚀 #explaw🐾 · #pawgainz · #A47DA4; 💭🧘🏻‍♀️✏️🏋️🏻‍♂️🗺🌠; }

If you read GB and PHES, that's becasue your browser (most browsers) render flags as the names of those flags.

So Pauline opens up with ".🐾💪🏻{". In CSS (she is a web developer) this is how you would open up and design a class. So she already has a cool little web dev thing in her bio. Her bio goes on to list her YouTube and her other website (we'll get to that in a second) before listing the hashtags she uses. She has a colour, noted as "#A47DA4" which I am to assume is her favourite colour.

Pauline always posts professional photographs of her, doing work, having done work, enjoying life, or just being a human like so:

<script async defer src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>

What's important to note here is that her instagram isn't entirely work, it's also fun human stuff too. You have to be **authentic**. You can't pretend to enjoy being in an office 24 / 7.

## Personal Website

As well as having a blog, Pauline has a personal website. Most of the successful people I know have personal websites. They're there as an online CV.

Look at Paulines website
http://paulinenarvas.com/

Some other notable websites that are impressive and act as online CV's are:

Chris' http://iamchrisjim.com/
Matt Burrmans - https://mattburman.com/
Simon Fish's - http://simon.fish/

All of these are computer scientists / coders, but you don't need to know how to code to have an online website.

This is my friend Shannen, who's an amazing photographer and has no coding experience:

https://shannenlong.pixieset.com/

Tim Ferris - who is everything but a coder - has a website too. Sure, he got people to code his website for him but back in the day (2002) he probably did it himself for his company at the time, brainQUICKEN.

"But Brandon, doesn't having a website cost money?"

You can use GitHub to host your website for free

https://pages.github.com/

And if you have no coding experience you can use something like Jekyll (google it)to create an easy website. Here's a GitHub reposotory that you can fork and change to have your own website:

https://github.com/jabranham/github-pages-academic-starter-kit

If you want to pay a little, Squarespace looks pretty nifty. Or you can pay one of the many developers I've listed (myself included) to make your website for you. Or any other developer you may know.

One of the advantages of having your own domain name is that you get an email for your domain name. How cool is it to email someone with the email address "pauline@paulinenarvas.com"?

# Know yourself

Questions will come up about you, about what you've done, about your CV.

Fully understand everything there is to know about yourself.

# Answereing interview questions

Always answer using the STAR method - Situation, task, action, result.

## 15 Interview Questions

According to Reed, there are really only 15 interview questions. All other interview questions stem from them.

1. Tell me about yourself

They don't care aobut your personal life. They want to hear your professional story. Tell a story, not some bullet points. 

This question is a combintion of of a candiate's self confidence and how well they have prepared. You need to answer this, right now. And memorise it. You know how businesses have elevator pitches? **YOU** need one.

Don't make it sound like you've never been asked this question before. Don't "uhm" or "ehh" before answering. Look them in the eye, smile, and rehearse it like you've always known this.

Make sure it has a definite end. Don't just end it willy-nilly and expect the interviewer to know it's ended. Always end with something like "And that to answer your question, is a little about me. If you want to know any more feel free to ask me."

Here's my own example:

>I'm a computer science student at the university of liverpool aiming to get a first class degree, previously studying computing at a local college.
>
>While at college I became the student union's higher education vice president. During this role I ran the collective college partnership's Student Union consisting of 5 colleges. Towards the end of my role the annual student survey was completed and every section for the student union, most noticably the student union satisfaction and representation area went up from 30% to around ~85%. The skills I learnt were to be an effecticve team player, to communicate complicated ideas to board members in meetings, interviewing skills and how to deal with deadlines which i believe will help me in this position during work.
> If there is anything else you would like to know, feel free to ask me.

Most candiates fail this question because they don't know what to talk about.

This question is asked in pretty much every interviewer. It allows the interviewer to get a rough idea of your background and experience and it also allows you to calm down.

2. Why are you applying?

So this question is really "What can you do that we need you to do?".
They want to know what problems you can solve.

Make sure to reflect the job specification in this.

In the Reed book "why you" they say that this can be expressed in one sentence:

>I'm applying because my **skills**, **experience**, and **motivation** are the **best fit for the job**.

This has to be customised per job interview, so no blanket answers here.

Don't say you:
* Need money
* You want to get out of the house
* A short commute is better than a long one

Act and believe that you want this job because you love it!

3. What are your greatest strengths?

Customise this question again. Reflect the job description within this question.

This is not the time to be humble, but do try to not sound arrogant.

An example of this answer could be something like:

"I'm an extremely hard worker. I often don't pick up many projects but when I do I go all in. Recently I've picked up blogging, managing to amass more than 8000 monthly readers in less than 5 months."

Do use statistics. This is really important. Statistics lets you talk big about yourself without sounding too egostitcal.

There's a difference between saying "God, if everyone who read my articles was their own country it would be a small country. I must be an amazing writer" and saying "I have 8000 monthly reads in 5 months".

But only say what's relevant. If I was applying to a job at a students union or anything to do with students I would say "I increased student satisfaction and approval ratings from 30% to ~90%".

You don't have to be given a statistic to use it. You can work it out yourself. You know all these maths classes you took? Now's a good time to use them. Do you deal with customers alot and do always say you're doing well? Put that into a statistic. 

Make sure your strengths match the job description. If the employer asks for good knowledge of Python (or German) talk about that. 

You see this?

![img](http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/wm/live/1280_720/images/live/p0/3j/nd/p03jndhw.jpg)

Do you remember this game? The idea is to get the shapes in the right holes.

Now, you could have the best blocks. The best blocks in the USA, the best blocks in the world. No one could ever have better blocks than you. But as long as you're trying to fit this amazing diamond cube into a triangular hole, it'll never ever work. 

The same can be said for job interviews. Often it's better to present something that you're only 60 - 80% good at that matches the job description rather than talking about something you are absolutely amazing at that doesn't match the job description.

The recruiter wants to find the right person for the job. They want to find the right shape for the right hole. Make sure you mould yourself into the shape they want.

4. What are your greatest weaknesses?

DO NOT USE weaknesses such as:
* I'm a hard worker
* I overwork so much
* I obsess with team work

Yeah sure this may have worked 30 - 40 years ago but employers can see the lies from miles away. Use an actual weakness but don't say something like:

>Sometimes I get really vivid thoughts of murdering someone

Use something that was a problem and talk about how you've overcome this. If you're still overcoming it say so. My example would be:

>"I used to be terrified of phone calls. The idea of phoning someone was a no go for me. Having worked in a students union and at multiple events it was inevtiable for me to phone people so I've gotten use to it. I'm still overcoming this but I'm not as bad as I was a year or two ago."

But don't make the weakness a part of the job description. If the job descritpion says "you ne
ed to be really good at talking to people" never say "I'm really bad at talking to someone".

Make sure you say how you overcame your weakness and turn it into something positive. Make it into a mini story.

Make sure this won't be a problem at your current company. Say something like "I believe this won't be a problem in this company" and then say why. Mine would be:

>"I used to be terrified of phone calls. The idea of phoning someone was a no go for me. Having worked in a students union and at multiple events it was inevtiable for me to phone people so I've gotten use to it. I'm still overcoming this but I'm not as bad as I was a year or two ago. I believe this won't be a problem at this company because I'm passionate for the cause of this company which would allow me to talk more on the phone to people revoling around this company. That's one of the reasons I want to join this company, because I get to do what I love and I get to push my bounadries and get out of my comfort zone, to grow both personally and professionally."

Make it very clear that this question is as normal as giving your name and address, do not act like they are forcing information out of you.

Whatever you do, under all circumstances, NEVER ever EVER reply with any of these:

* I'm a perfectionist! (If you do this honestly, you don't deserve the job.)
* I work too hard
* I don't have any!
* Chocolate / food

5. What will your skills and ideas bring to this company?

This question is basically:

> Why should we care about you? What can you do that others can't?

And this question, is one of the best questions possible.

> What can you do that others can't?

They are literally asking you to mow down your competition. Do not show mercy, destroy them. 

If you've worked on a __preproject__ (mentioned in this article) this is the time to say so. Something like:

> I saw your company used this Python package on GitHub but that Python package is deprecated. I've actually made a Python package that works the same but uses all the conventions that Python requires now. It's also a little bit faster.

You have to really customise this one per company. Play your A-game here.

Do not talk badly about other people, just focus on your srengths.

Normally you will want to focus on what you're good at here. Talk about that

6. What’s your preferred management style?

This question is just the interviewer wanting to know if you are going to get along together.

7. Where do you see yourself in five years’ time?

This question is the employer wanting to know if you plan to work there for a long time. Every employer wants to know you'll work there for a long time, even if it's just a waitering job.

Say something along the lines of:

> I don't know your company well enough, but I would like to think I would still be working here. In 5 years time I would have liked to learnt enough to be able to train people in future roles.

8. How would you approach this job?


9. What have you achieved in other roles?

This is the question which gives you permission to not be humbled. Talk about what ever you're produest of. Mine would be:

> My role as Higher Education Vice President started off on a bad turn. There were supposed to be 5 student union officers, but only I wanted to do the job. Effectively leaving me in charge of the work of 5 people, all whilest the student union staff who work with us had left to go to another job.
>
> Luckily this was perfect for me, as I stepped up when no one else would. I travelled to every campus as much as possible to make sure all students were listened to. When a group of students came to me telling me that their course isn't being properly funded I demanded a meeting with the principle of East Kent College to fix this.
>
> As well as this I repeatedly represented the students in a democratic way at both a local (Kent) way and in a national way. I was chosen to attend the National Union of Student's National Confernece, where I elected the next NUS officer team and chose to represent my college on a national scale.
>
> By the end of the year the students were asked to fill out a survey about their time at college. Student union approval ratings were previously laying around 30%, with about 5 questions about the student's union. By the time I finished, it laid around 90% with comments from students saying about how amazing it was for their problems to be fixed so easily.
> 
> On top of this, I received a letter from the Chief Executive President of Student Welfare saying that I was the best Student Union's Officer ever and rewarding me with a £50 Amazon voucher.

Notice how I'm tooting my own horn here, this question allows you to do that.


10. What did you like and dislike about your last job?

11. How did you hear about this position?

This question is simply the inteerview asking you a normal question. No unique tricks here. Use this question to show your passion for the company, but be genuine. If you've known about a company for years then say so.

12. Why should we hire / choose you?

You should come up with a standardised answer here that can be customised per company.

# Change "uhhhh" to "    "

Instead of saying "uhhhh" and "ehhhhhh" just pause. Smile. DO NOT rush through your interview.

# Ask for a pause

In Karate we have something called a Kata, which is like a dance of all the moves you're supposed to know at your level. It's perfectly okay that _between_ moves you take a short pause, a little break to think about what your next move is but when you perform the next move you do it strongly and fast.

The same can be said for interviews. It's perfectly okay to say

> Sorry, I'm feeling a little nervous. Do you mind if I have a few seconds to myself so I can calm down?

The interviewer knows your nervous. The difference here is that you've recgonised this and you've done something to try to mitigate it. Most people who are interviewed are nervous and they never stop being nervous. They just talk and talk and talk and rush through everything.

In Karate if you rushed through your Kata it would be extremely ugly and convulated. The same holds for interviews. Do not rush through questions. Don't even worry about a time limit. If you're calm and careful the interviwer will keep track of time.

# Interview Formats

## Face to Face

The normal interview format. You'll be interviewed by 1 or 2 people at most. They'll ask you questions relating to the job.

## Online Video Interview

You will be given a set of questions and you will have to record yourself for 15 - 30 minutes answering the questions. The interviewer loves this format because if you bore them after the first 15 seconds they can just stop watching. They can't just walk out in a face to face interview.

Some companies (such as Barclays) use Artifical Inatelligence to read your face and use that to determine whether or not you go onto the next stage.

## Skype Interview

The employer will skype you and will ask you questions as if it is face to face. Whatever you do, make sure you're in a quiet environment with good internet.

Some tips for Skype and Online VIdeo interviews:

* Make sure to look the part
* Prepare the environment. Look behhind you, that's what they'll see. Make sure it's nice a mess. Try to interview with a white background behind you.
* Practice it, skype a friend and ask them to help out.
* Smile, a lot.
* Stay present. Don't go googling stuff mid interview.
* You can have notes in front of you. Take this to your advantage. Place your CV, company info, quesitons you want to ask infront of you so but make it so your interviewer can't see them.
* DO NOT wear a headset or headphones. It looks unprofessional.

Here's an example of a Skype interview:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1CT5wr0I1c

Here's a very famous example of a bad Skype interview:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1CT5wr0I1c

## Phone Interview

Normally used to determine if you're worth coming into the company for an interview. Almost always one employer interviewing you. 

Some tips for phone interviews:

* You can have your stuff in front of you. Have your CV, questions for the company, whatever you want. Just don't play around with paper too loudly.
* Make sure it's a high quality phone call
* You can Google things (quietly). But never google the answer to a question.
* Disable phone notifcations when on the phone
* Do not have your pets / children / family disrupt you.
* Answer your phone with "Hello, YOUR NAME here."
* Smile, even if they can't see you. It'll come through on the phone.
* Watch your body language. Don't fidget too much.

## Online Tests

Quite often an employer will require you to take an online test to pass onto the real interview. These can include numerical reasoning, verbal reasoning, and problem solving. These will all be talked about shortly.

## Assessment Centres

You will go to an assessment centre where you will be interviewed and tested, usually on your problem solving skills and your abillity to work in a team. Here are some typical assessment centre activities, taken from [here](https://careerhub.liv.ac.uk/docs/4/Assessment_Centres.pdf).

Assessment | What's Involved | What they're looking for
--- | --- | ---
Social Events | Meeting other candiates | Interpersonal skills
Group activities like discussing a topic, or making an object | Team work, time management, creativity, problem solving
Presentations | Giving an oral presentation to an individual or group which you may or may not have prepared | Candiates who can organise their matieral and speak fluently
Interviews | In depth discussions | Competence to do job, enthusiasm, interpersonal skills
Personality questionaires | Asess what you are like as a person and how you might react in different situations | Candiates who fit their company culture
Psychometric tests | Timed tests, verbal tests, numeric tests | Ability / apitude for the job
Information sessions | Presentation on opportunties available | Active listening - cues you are paying attention.

In group exercises you have to be inclusive, you have to include everyone in solving a problem.

Most of the time you will be asked to give a presentation, practice this a lot. Do as many presentations as you can before the assessment.

Very commonly you'll be asked to retake the tests you've done online such as verbal reasoning, numerical reasoning. Sometimes people get their friends to do these online, so this is a test to make sure you know what you're doing.


### Social events

Any part of the assessment centre that is said to be "informal". This can and will still effect your outcome. Use the time to ask lots of questions, make notes that may be useful in any future interviews with the company. This can either be a small networking event, having lunch or having dinner.

### Group Activities

So this is probably some problem solving topic that you have to solve in a group.

Normally you'll encounter one of these problems:

Business scenarios - Often linked to the business. This can include coming up with new ideas for the company, setting a budget, planning a holiday, how to make a new product, case studies of charities.

Ranking exercises - This can be anything from your top 10 favourite songs to being given a 4 page list of 40 different people and being told that only 10 of them can survive on an island, the rest will have to die.

Physical tasks - Building things etc.

Role plays - Customers facing problems, sales positions (having to sell an item to someone), management roles.

Normally one or two instructors will watch you.

Don't dominate the discussion, let everyone speak and if someones quiet ask them for their input. Try to present your idea as it'll make you stand out from the group. Don't worry if one person is being seen as too dominating as it likely won't impress the recruiter.

### Presentations

You will likely be asked to give a presentation about something, often you will not know the topic and will be given 20 - 30 minutes to present. See the Presentations section for more information on this.

### Tests

See the tests section for more information on this. These can come up at assessment centres.

## Panel Interview

You will be interviewed by a panel of people, as oppose to just 1 or 2 people.

## Group Interview

You will be interviewed as a group. As in multiple candiates will be interviewed by one interviewer (or panel).

Employers do this type of interview becaues it is extremely efficient.

In this style you want to stand out. You can do this by:

* Being confident and respectful. Understand that group interviews are efficient and no, the employers do not hate you for doing it.
* Be a leader. If you are working on a team project, find an opportunity to lead.
* Be yourself and be authentic.
* Follow up - Send a thank you email after the interview.

## Following up after an interview

After the interview, email the interviewer to say thank you. Try to mention something specific so the interview will remember you.

It doesn't even have to be an email. It can even be on a social network as long as it's professional.

Here's a direct message I sent to someone after going to one of their talks:

>Dear Cain, I was at your Natwest talk at the University of Liverpool. I really enjoyed it and I noticed you talked about API's and Cryptocurrencies. Being a computer scientist this really intrigued me! Do you happen to have any upcoming talks about fintech, cryptocurrencies, apps or maybe even personal brand development at Natwest?

Here's a message my friend [Kunal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kunal-agarwala/) sent to someone as a follow up:

>Hello, 
> I was at the technology showcase event in Manchester today and found your input in the panel very intereting. I have already secured a place on the spring week in Radbroke and look forward to potentially working with you.
>
> Many thanks,
> Kunal Agarwala

# Styles of Interview

There can be many different styles of interviews that match the formats of interviews.

## Competency Interview

These types of interviews require applicants to give specific encounters of times they have solved problems. They want to see you are compotent. This is where the _pre-project_ comes into play as well. What better way to prove you're good at something if you've actually done it?

Competency based interviews will usually have the interviewer read questions off of a bit of paper or their laptop, and they will probably take notes. 

The type of questions that come up here will be very strictly formatted. The questions proposed above are mainly compotency based interview questions.

## Strength Based Interviews

A strength based interview focuses on what you enjoy doing, rather than what you can do like in a competency based interview. Strength based interviews come from "positive" psychology. The theory states that by matching you with what you enjoy doing you'll be happier in your role, will perform better and stay with the company for longer.

The interviewer will likely not have any questions written done for this, or not many. They may ask something like "tell me about your favourite day out" and they will ask questions based on your answers, to really gage you as a person. These types of interviews will normally feel like a formal chat with a friend rather than a one on one interview.

More and more companies are switching to strength based interviews, with these companies publicly saying they use them:

* Aviva
* BAE Systems
* Barclays
* Cisco 
* EY 
* Nestle
* Royal Mail

Strength based questions don't have a binary "right or wrong" answer. However, do be a decent human being. Don't talk badly about other people, don't lie, just be nice.

Just like every other type of interview you'll need to incldude examples to back up your responses.#

Here are some examples of strength based interview quesitons, taken from [here](https://www.prospects.ac.uk/careers-advice/interview-tips/strength-based-interviews).

* What do you like to do in your spare time?
* What energises you?
* How would your close friends describe you?
* Do you most like starting tasks or finishing them?
* Do you prefer the big picture or the small details?
* Describe a successful day. What made it successful?
* What are you good at?
* What are your weaknesses?
* What did you enjoy studying at school or university?
* When did you achieve something you’re really proud of?
* What do you enjoy doing the least?
* Do you find there are enough hours in the day to complete your to-do list?
* What tasks are always left on your to-do list?
* How do you stay motivated?
* How do you feel about deadlines?
* Have you ever done something differently the second time around?
* Do you think this role will play to your strengths?


## Stress Based Interviews

A stress based interview is designed to make you stressed, to put you under pressure to see how well you do.
0
The logic is that the way you respond under stress during the interview is indicative of the way you'll handle similar situations on the job.

Creating an emotionally chaotic setting puts candidates under psychological stress to see if they will crack, remain calm, or even thrive under pressure.

Stress interviews can be controversial because they create a sensitive and emotionally charged relationship between the applicant and the hiring manager, and thereby the company. Sometimes, even the most successful applicants will turn down an offer on account of the nature of the interview alone.

Here's some stress based interview questions, taken from [here](https://www.betterteam.com/stress-interview-questions).

* How do you feel this interview is going?
* How would you handle undeserved criticism from a superior?
* How many other jobs are you applying for?
* What would you do if you saw a colleague stealing supplies or equipment?
* What did you do when you had a boss you didn’t get along with?
* What would you do if a colleague took credit for your idea, and got a promotion?
* Was the stress of your previous job too much for you?
* What would you do if a colleague admitted to lying on their resume to get the job?
* What would you do if a customer verbally insulted you in front of co-workers?
* What would you change about the design of a baseball hat?
* Why were you fired from your previous job?
* How successful do you think you've been so far?


## Technical Interviews

A technical interview is used heavily in the computer science industry. It usually involves coding.

## Structured Interview

A structured interview is just another describing word for an interview. A structured interview will usually follow a structure, where the questions are asked in a standard pace and are normally read off of a sheet of paper.

## Unstructured Interview

Like above, an unstructured interview is just another describing word. These usually have perhaps 1 or 2 questions to start you off but all questions will mainly come from the interviewer curious as to your life.

## The Lunch interview 

One of the more informal types of interviews. The interviewer will buy you lunch and will interview you over lunch.

Do some research on the restaurent you are going to. Try to decide what you will order in advance, before reaching the restaurent. Although a restaurent might feel more informal than an interview, make sure to dress the part.

If you're applying for a company like Google, where everyone wears jeans and hoodies then wear jeans and a hoodie. Make sure you know what the company expects. Most businesses will require suits.

Try to arrive 15 minutes before the time of the reservation and meet the employer outside the restaurent. 

best thing you can do is take the lead from your interviewers. When you sit down, casually ask if they’ve been to the restaurant before and what they think are good options—hopefully their recommendations will give you a sense of an appropriate price range. If not, when the wait staff arrives, try to have your interviewer order first and choose something at that price point (or less).

Also, be sure to pick an option that will be easy to eat while you’re talking. (Hint: Forkfuls of Caesar salad are easier to maneuver than a massive, messy sandwich.)

Finally, no matter how casual your employer may be, you want to put forward your very, very best self. This means: Stay away from ordering alcohol, even if the interviewers do. If you get the job, you will have plenty of opportunities to share a drink with them—the interview is not the time or place to start.

## Career Fair Interview

## Interview Red Flags

Here are some red flags of interviews:

* Your interviewer is very late
A little late is okay, but very late? They obviously do not care about you.

* Your interviwer disrespects members of staff in front of you
If they disrespect other members of staff, they are likely going to disrespect you.

* They haven't read your CV

* They speak negatively about past employees
Again, if they disrespect past employees they'll likely disrespect you.

* They swear and cuss
Not professional. At all.

* The company has high turnover, they repeatedly lose employees
There's a reason they lose a lot of emplyoees.

* The companies online reviews are bad

If any of these appear in the interivew, you should think twice about working there.

# Psychometric Tests

All of these tests are strictly timed, usually giving you 30 minutes for 30 questions. Some companies do not care if you don't complete the entire test in time. One recruiter even told me that they make them harder to put people under stress.

## Numeracy tests

A numeracy test is a test designed to gauge how well your daily maths skills are and how well they can be applied to a companies situation.

There isn't really any tricks to this other than to practice. You can Google "Numerical Reasoning tests" to find some online.

You should take your own calculator (or have your own).

You should know your calculator. Watch some Youtube videos on it to learn all the cool tricks.

Use any rough paper for calculations.

The more you practice the more you can understand graphs.

Check units, don't mix different units unless you know how to convert.


## Verbal Reasoning

Normally involves reading a bit of paper and answering questions about it.

Tips:

Take every word literally. You are being asked a question and the answer is in some text they gave you.

## Personality Test

A test to find out your personallity.

Usually indicates:

* How you relate to other people
* How you work with other people
* How you work
* Your motivation
* Your preferences and attitudes

There is no right or wrong answer here,

# Presentations

Have lots of pictures on your presentation. Steve Jobs **NEVER** had any writing on his presentations and he's really good, so follow that. But do try to write a little bit if it helps. Don't read off the script or the slides. Make sure they engage with you. Don't speak monotone. Act excited. 

Make sure your presentation follows a linear story, human beings are more prone to paying attention to stories.

# Preprojects

This is a project you take prior to working at the company. It's something that benefits them before you work for them.

Take for example this website: [Nina4AirBnB](http://www.nina4airbnb.com/).

This website lists all the things AirBnB are doing badly and talks about how they can improve. This even made it into National Newspapers:

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/airbnb-ceo-san-francisco-middle-east-travel-and-tourism-cv-linkedin-employment-a8158311.html

Because of this pre-project, she got an interview straight away:

![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*dzgczF9zljYaDwaGHq89Gg.png)

I know it takes time, research and dedication to do this but once you've done it you're almost guranteed an interview. What better way to show a company that you're hard working, dedicated to their cause and the company, and are a good researcher than to actually do a project like this?

Sure, you could say you are these things. But to go out of your way to do something for a company way before you even have an interview? That's something they'll love.

At YCombinator's Startup school they talk about how all employees must be passionate and dedicated to the business. It is rumoured that at Airbnb they ask the question "If you only have 1 year to live, would you still work here?" to see how passionate someone is about their cause.

Preprojects don't just work for tech, they can work for basically any business that has projects and all businesses have projects.

Let's say you want to work at an amusement park, like Dreamland or Thorpe Park. You can research and perhaps suggest an event for them or something along those lines. Like, hey, there's alot of this population in Margate (where Dreamland is) that don't fall into the demographiv "White - British". These people also celebrate this holiday on this day, maybe you should make an event out of it at Dreamland?

# Questions to ask your interviewer

1. What skills and experiences would make an ideal candidate?

This question makes the interviewer say out loud what they are looking for.

2. How would you describe a typical day and week in this position?

This question is just making sure that you are a good match for the position.

3. When can I expect to hear from you?

This question is handy to prevent your nerves from getting the better of you.

4. Describe the culture of the company.

This makes sure you are comfortable with the culture of the company.

6. What do you like most about working for this company?

This let's you connect with the interviewer on a personal level.

## Some small hints

Avoid questions that are about you like the salary, vacation time, work hours etc.

Avoid questions that can be answered "yes" or "no".

Like most things in job hunting you'll want to customise these questions per company. The ones above are general but a good specific question about something the interviewer said will show you are listening.

# Career Fairs

Career Fairs are really popular in universities, sixth forms, and colleges so this section will all be about career fairs.

## Preperation

Some people have business cards, but outside of Asia they're not really much of a thing. They still exist, and you can have them, but they're not used so much.

Research the companies that will be attending. Make a priority list of all the companies that you want to see.

Make sure your CV is up to scratch and good looking, as you'll be handing this out a lot. Also make sure you print lots of copies of it.

Have an elevator pitch ready for yourself. An elevator pitch is a 30 second pitch designed to let someone roughly know what you're about. It should feature your current positions, any important past positions and your general goals and life motto. Mine is:

> Hi, I'm Brandon. Obsessive Learner and Problem Solver. Future world changer. Currently a computer science student at the University of Liverpool and a journalist for Hacker Noon. Previously Higher Education Vice President of the East Kent Group.

Your elevator pitch needs to be persusive, it should make the listener interested in you. It should detail some skills you know and what your future goals are.

Avoid rambling when giving an elevator pitch, don't frown or speak monotonely and don't restrict yourself to just one elevator pitch. You can haved more than 1 depending on who you talk to.

## What to wear

Dress smart. Imagine it's like a job interview.

## Best Questions to Ask at a Careers Fair

The questions to ask can either be generic or tailored to the industry (which usually impresses recruiters but requires prior commercial awareness).

Some common generic questions to ask are:

* Where do you see yourself in 5 years time?
This forces the recruiter to talk about themselves and people love talking about themselves.

* What are some of the interesting projectrs you are working on right now?

* What are the challenges facing the company?

## General Tips

At the very end of every converstation always ask "can I contact you with further questions, do you have a business card?" and if they don't write down their name, add their LinkedIn and add a customised message to the add so they know who you are.

Make sure to have lots of copies of your CV!

# Personal Hygine

# Dressing right

# Networking

Networking is the **science** of meeting like minded people and befriending them in order to advance yourself in your career. Networking can happen anywhere, anytime - but it is normally undertaken at a __networking event__. You can find networkin events by using [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com) or using LinkedIn.

When at a networking event do try to look and act professional. Depending on the event you may not need to wear attire suitable for an interview. If it's a casual breakfast / lunch event normal work clothes will be fine.

https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im_an_exrecruiter_for_some_of_the_top_companies/

    Find a job you're interested in that you could be a good fit for. If you're a fit for 70% of the job requirements that's probably okay
    Don't apply for it immediately. It's tempting but if you do it will actually reduce your chances later on. If I applied first without a referral I got an interview 14% of the time. If I applied and then got a referral it only went up to 17% of the time. This is because the recruiter may have already looked at my resume and rejected me and they usually won't take a second look just because someone referred me.
    Instead, look up the company page on LinkedIn and click 'See all employees on LinkedIn'
    Look for 1st or 2nd degree connections. Do not trust the LinkedIn filter for 2nd or 3rd degree connections. For some reason I found that the filter would show nobody as a 2nd degree connection but if I scrolled through the pages I would find several 2nd degree connections.
    If you have a 1st degree connection, send them a message. "Hey [friend, old coworker, childhood nemesis]! I've been looking around at new jobs and see that you're working at [company]. Can I buy you a coffee and pick your brain about it a bit? I can meet you somewhere close to your office so it's easy for you. Any days next week work well?"
    If you have a 2nd degree connection, send your existing friend a message. "Hey, it's been a while since we talked, I hope that [something you know about them] is going well! I'm looking for a new job and saw that you know [person] at [company]. I'd love to get in touch with them and figure out what it's like working there. Do you know them well enough to put me in touch? If it's helpful I can email you a quick intro blurb about me that you can just forward on to them."
    If you absolutely can't find someone you know at a company, go ahead and apply for it normally.
    Here's the priority order of people to reach out to. People who would be your peers (most relevant discussion, most relevant possible referral) -> the hiring manager for the role you want (most relevant discussion) -> sales people (always open to networking) -> anybody else (hey, there's a chance they can introduce you to the people above) -> recruiters (used to being annoyed by job seekers, actively trying to filter out candidates).
    Figure out some questions you have about the company that don't have the answer somewhere on their website. "What do you think about what [competitor] is doing?" or "I saw in the news that you just launched [new product]. Where did the idea for that come from?" or "How do you guys usually handle [thing related to the job you want]?" Focus on questions that are related to the role you want to do so that you have knowledge you can use in interviews later.
    Meet the person for coffee or over the phone. Ask your intelligent questions. Be interested in what they do and their company. You're 1) having a nice, social conversation, 2) showing them that you're smart / interested and 3) having them like you enough to root for you. Try not to bring up the job until they do or until you have about 5 minutes left. They'll usually ask how they can help you.
    Mention that you saw a role and that you think you'd be a good fit for it because of [reason, reason, reason]. If the rest of the conversation went well they'll usually offer to refer you. If they don't, ask things like "Do you know who I could get in touch with about that role? Do you know who might be the hiring manager for it?" Send the resume along.
