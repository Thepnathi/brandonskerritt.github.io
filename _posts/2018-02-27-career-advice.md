So I got really sick and tired of seeing "How to get the perfect job" and then them only giving you like 3 paragraphs and saying "buy my book or sign up to my email list to get the rest XDDDDDDD" so I'm releasing all the informatiomn I've learnt from these scam artists for free.

Also I'm really sick and tired of Medium articles that are 5 - 7 minutes long and they talk about how amazing the author is and then they release a single sentence of information that's useful. So this is a no-thrills no-handrails guide to jobs.
# CV

## Personalise your CV

Seriously, customise your CV per job. Don't send the same CV out to many jobs. Think about what you've done that's important to the job.

Customising your CV enables you to pass the keyword test.

When you apply for a job, some jobs will read your CV to see if it contains certain keywords. If it doesn't, no job for you.

Your CV will impress the person reading it if its customiesd to them. Everyone likes a customiesd birthday cake more than a regular Tesco own brand birthday cake.

To customise your CV analyse thejob description. Read it multiple times and highlight keywords that come up. They say that they want someone with strong self motivation? Find something you've done that proves this and put it onto your CV.

Read the job description, the responsibillities, the specific requirements, the location. Any words you don't know? They're probably keywords. Google them.

Let's say a job description has this sentence in it:

> Required - Advance knowledge of Microsoft Applications (Word, Excel, Powerpoint).

Then instead of writing "Microsoft office" on your CV you write:

> Advance knowledge of Microsoft Software (Word, Excel, Powerpoint).

If you know a little tiny bit about computers you can Google "LaTeX CV templates" to get some really nice templates for free. If it's on Overleaf or ShareLaTeX than good. LaTeX is basically like a programming language but for writing.

## Lie about your location

Want to get a job in London? Then write "London" on your CV. No company wants to worry about someone commuting from Kent every day. They don't have to know.

But make sure it's not too much of a lie. Saying you live in London when you're from Skegness or St. Ives is a blatent lie.

## Writing a CV

Make it 1 page. If you customise your CV per job, you should only ever need 1 page. If you have 20+ years of experience, 2 pages is okay, but 1 page is preferable.

Use a CV template and fill it out.

List your achievements at a job, not the duties you had to do.

Avoid spelling and grammar mistakes at all costs. Pay someone to read over it if you have to.

Don't fill it chock full of information. Keep it short and sweet.

Use numbers. In the UK we have this English writing rule:

>A FOREST. A Alliteration F Facts O Opinion R Repetition / Rhetorical questions E Emotive language S Statistics T Triples (Three, rule of) 

The statistics is important here. If I was to say that I was the best Student Union officer that would make me sound bigheaded. If I was to change that to "changed Student Union approval rating from 30% to 90%" it would sound even more impressive and not so egotisical.

## Make it as easy for your employer as possible

Really think about who you are applying to. If you're applying in the tech industry chances are that they reading your CV on a computer, so hyperlinks in CVs are really cool. If not, maybe don't include them as they don't look good when printed out.

## Use a template

I cannot stress this enough. There are hundreds, if not thousands of amazing CV templates online. Just Google "CV Template" and you'll find one.

## Please just customise it for your job

If you're applying for a job that requires programming, have a "languages" section on your CV that talks about all the languages you know.

## Have a "profile" section

This profile is a small section of your CV that includes a brief summary of your skills, experiences and goals. It is your elevator pitch.

It really is customised to you. I can't tell you what to write. You can find examples of profiles in the example CV section.

## Bullet Points in a CV

Do not write paragraphs. Have bullet points instead.

For any past work or experience you will want to include accomplishments at this job that relate to the job you are applying to.

Try not to include your duties. It's much more impessible to show your accomplishments.

In your bullet points use action verbs. These are words like "accomplished", "designed", "initated", "supervised".

## Things to include in a CV

Let's say you have a template and you want to change a few few things,here are some things you might want to include:

* Personal details - Telephone, professional email, location - Name
* Work experience
* Achievements
* Education
* Hobbies and interests that relate to the job
* Key skills relating to the job
* Know any languages that relate to the job? Put them down!

What not to include:
* A headshot / image of you. Unless the company specifies that they require this, do not do this. Unless you are Alex Turner or Emma Watson they do not want to see you.
* Age and date of birth - It's illegal for employers to ask about your age under the Equality Act of 2010.
* Martial / Relationship status - Again under the Equality Act of 2010 they cannot ask this.

Depending on your work and education, you'll need to balence these correctly. Do you have a really good education but not much work experience? Make your education 60% of your CV. Do you have lots of work experience but not much education? Make that 60% of your CV.

What if you have both? Well, just list your education shortly and have your work experience.

How do you list education shortly? Just include the modules that sound the most impressive, try to limit it to 4 maximum along with your grades and university name. Or, again, personalise it. You're applying for a job that involves Artifical Intelligence? Include the modules you've done in this.

## Examples

Here are some examples of CVs. This is my CV

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u66tSfXWmvBBdCkc7KyUpLxn8A0U8Rar/view

And this is Chris's CV

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rIBsYaRf6qSg9wND32cw4WAAbCBHG0W2/view

TK maybe have photos

# Email

You need a professional email address.

Make it your name, don't use Yahoo or AOL for tech jobs. If you apply to Google with an AOL email address they'll just laugh at you.

Make sure you think about this carefully. I have 2 email addresses, a Gmail one that has numbers on the end of it and a Proton mail one that's just my name. 

The Proton mail one is for tech companies. They might see I use Proton and subconsciously like me based on the fact that I support encryption.

If your email address looks like "FancyMonkey6969@tiscali.com" you need to change this.

# Personal Brand

Everyone has a personal brand, but it's up to you to decide when to take control of your personal brand.

A majority of your posts on social media should be about what you love, but don't make it too fake. Only posting tech stuff / stuff related to your industry makes you seem boring to work with. I genuinely love dogs so much, so I often post adorable dog pictures on my Twitter or pictures / things related to martial arts but I also post alot about technology.

## Create some content

Whether this is writing blog posts, tweeting super nifty tricks you've learnt, weighing in on a converstation on Twitter or contributing to open source software.

The more you create, the more people will care about you. No one cares about you unless you can make them smarter or do something for them.

## LinkedIn

Get a LinkedIn account. Make sure it's professional. Have a nice headshot photograph.

Here's a good LinkedIn inforgraphic from [here](https://www.leisurejobs.com/getasset/7a3e4167-6675-4ae3-be01-6ff723b80f2a/).

# Know yourself

Questions will come up about you, about what you've done, about your CV.

Fully understand everything there is to know about yourself.

# Pre project

# Answereing interview questions
STAR METHOD

# 15 Interview Questions

According to Reed, there are really only 15 interview questions. All other interview questions stem from them.

1. Tell me about yourself

They don't care aobut your personal life. They want to hear your professional story. Tell a story, not some bullet points. 

This question is a combintion of of a candiate's self confidence and how well they have prepared. You need to answer this, right now. And memorise it. You know how businesses have elevator pitches? **YOU** need one.

Don't make it sound like you've never been asked this question before. Don't "uhm" or "ehh" before answering. Look them in the eye, smile, and rehearse it like you've always known this.

Make sure it has a definite end. Don't just end it willy-nilly and expect the interviewer to know it's ended. Always end with something like "And that to answer your question, is a little about me. If you want to know any more feel free to ask me."

Here's my own example:

>I'm a computer science student at the university of liverpool aiming to get a first class degree, previously studying computing at a local college.

>While at college I became the student union's higher education vice president. During this role I improved the collective college partnership consisting of 5 colleges. Towards the end of my role the annual student survey was completed and every section for the student union, most noticably the student union satisfaction and representation area went up by 30% to around ~85%. The skills I learnt was to be an effecticve team player, to communicate complicated ideas to board members in meetings, interviewing skills and how to deal with deadlines which i believe will help me in this position during work.


2. Why are you applying?

So this question is really "What can you do that we need you to do?".
They want to know what problems you can solve.

Make sure to reflect the job specification in this.

In the Reed book "why you" they say that this can be expressed in one sentence:

>I'm applying because my **skills**, **experience**, and **motivation** are the **best fit for the job**.

This has to be customised per job interview, so no blanket answers here.

Don't say you:
* Need money
* You want to get out of the house
* A short commute is better than a long one

Act and believe that you want this job because you love it!

3. What are your greatest strengths?

Customise this question again. Reflect the job description within this question.

This is not the time to be humble.

An example of this answer could be something like:

"I'm an extremely hard worker. I often don't pick up many projects but when I do I go all in. Recently I've picked up blogging, managing to amass more than 8000 monthly readers in less than 5 months."

Do use statistics. This is really important. Statistics lets you talk big about yourself without sounding too egostitcal.

There's a difference between saying "God, if everyone who read my articles was their own country it would be a small country. I must be an amazing writer" and saying "I have 8000 monthly reads in 5 months".

But only say what's relevant. If I was applying to a job at a students union or anything to do with students I would say "I increased student satisfaction and approval ratings from 30% to ~90%".

You don't have to be given a statistic to use it. You can work it out yourself. You know all these maths classes you took? Now's a good time to use them. Do you deal with customers alot and do always say you're doing well? Put that into a statistic. 

4. What are your greatest weaknesses?

DO NOT USE weaknesses such as:
* I'm a hard worker
* I overwork so much
* I obsess with team work

Yeah sure this may have worked 30 - 40 years ago but employers can see the lies from miles away. Use an actual weakness but don't say something like:

>Sometimes I get really vivid thoughts of murdering someone

Use something that was a problem and talk about how you've overcome this. If you're still overcoming it say so. My example would be:

>"I used to be terrified of phone calls. The idea of phoning someone was a no go for me. Having worked in a students union and at multiple events it was inevtiable for me to phone people so I've gotten use to it. I'm still overcoming this but I'm not as bad as I was a year or two ago."


5. What will your skills and ideas bring to this company?

This question is basically:

> Why should we care about you? What can you do that others can't?

And this question, is one of the best questions possible.

> What can you do that others can't?

They are literally asking you to mow down your competition. Do not show mercy, destroy them. 

If you've worked on a __preproject__ (mentioned in this article) this is the time to say so. Something like:

> I saw your company used this Python package on GitHub but that Python package is deprecated. I've actually made a Python package that works the same but uses all the conventions that Python requires now. It's also a little bit faster.

6. What’s your preferred management style?

7. Where do you see yourself in five years’ time?

8. How would you do this job?

9. What have you achieved in other roles?

10. What did you like and dislike about your last job?

# Change "uhhhh" to "    "

Instead of saying "uhhhh" and "ehhhhhh" just pause. Smile. DO NOT rush through your interview.

# Ask for a pause

In Karate we have something called a Kata, which is like a dance of all the moves you're supposed to know at your level. It's perfectly okay that _between_ moves you take a short pause, a little break to think about what your next move is but when you perform the next move you do it strongly and fast.

The same can be said for interviews. It's perfectly okay to say

> Sorry, I'm feeling a little nervous. Do you mind if I have a few seconds to myself so I can calm down?

The interviewer knows your nervous. The difference here is that you've recgonised this and you've done something to try to mitigate it. Most people who are interviewed are nervous and they never stop being nervous. They just talk and talk and talk and rush through everything.

In Karate if you rushed through your Kata it would be extremely ugly and convulated. The same holds for interviews. Do not rush through questions. Don't even worry about a time limit. If you're calm and careful the interviwer will keep track of time.

# Interview Formats

## Face to Face

The normal interview format. You'll be interviewed by 1 or 2 people at most. They'll ask you questions relating to the job.

## Online Video Interview

You will be given a set of questions and you will have to record yourself for 15 - 30 minutes answering the questions. The interviewer loves this format because if you bore them after the first 15 seconds they can just stop watching. They can't just walk out in a face to face interview.

Some companies (such as Barclays) use Artifical Inatelligence to read your face and use that to determine whether or not you go onto the next stage.

## Skype Interview

The employer will skype you and will ask you questions as if it is face to face. Whatever you do, make sure you're in a quiet environment with good internet.

Some tips for Skype and Online VIdeo interviews:

* Make sure to look the part
* Prepare the environment. Look behhind you, that's what they'll see. Make sure it's nice a mess. Try to interview with a white background behind you.
* Practice it, skype a friend and ask them to help out.
* Smile, a lot.
* Stay present. Don't go googling stuff mid interview.
* You can have notes in front of you. Take this to your advantage. Place your CV, company info, quesitons you want to ask infront of you so but make it so your interviewer can't see them.
* DO NOT wear a headset or headphones. It looks unprofessional.

## Phone Interview

Normally used to determine if you're worth coming into the company for an interview. Almost always one employer interviewing you. 

Some tips for phone interviews:

* You can have your stuff in front of you. Have your CV, questions for the company, whatever you want. Just don't play around with paper too loudly.
* Make sure it's a high quality phone call
* You can Google things (quietly). But never google the answer to a question.
* Disable phone notifcations when on the phone
* Do not have your pets / children / family disrupt you.
* Answer your phone with "Hello, YOUR NAME here."
* Smile, even if they can't see you. It'll come through on the phone.
* Watch your body language. Don't fidget too much.

## Online Tests

Quite often an employer will require you to take an online test to pass onto the real interview. These can include numerical reasoning, verbal reasoning, and problem solving. These will all be talked about shortly.

## Assessment Centres

You will go to an assessment centre where you will be interviewed and tested, usually on your problem solving skills and your abillity to work in a team.

## Panel Interview

You will be interviewed by a panel of people, as oppose to just 1 or 2 people.

## Group Interview

You will be interviewed as a group. As in multiple candiates will be interviewed by one interviewer (or panel).

Employers do this type of interview becaues it is extremely efficient.

In this style you want to stand out. You can do this by:

* Being confident and respectful. Understand that group interviews are efficient and no, the employers do not hate you for doing it.
* Be a leader. If you are working on a team project, find an opportunity to lead.
* Be yourself and be authentic.
* Follow up - Send a thank you email after the interview.

## Following up after an interview

After the interview, email the interviewer to say thank you. Try to mention something specific so the interview will remember you.

It doesn't even have to be an email. It can even be on a social network as long as it's professional.

Here's a direct message I sent to someone after going to one of their talks:

>Dear Cain, I was at your Natwest talk at the University of Liverpool. I really enjoyed it and I noticed you talked about API's and Cryptocurrencies. Being a computer scientist this really intrigued me! Do you happen to have any upcoming talks about fintech, cryptocurrencies, apps or maybe even personal brand development at Natwest?

Here's a message my friend [Kunal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kunal-agarwala/) sent to someone as a follow up:

>Hello, 
> I was at the technology showcase event in Manchester today and found your input in the panel very intereting. I have already secured a place on the spring week in Radbroke and look forward to potentially working with you.
>
> Many thanks,
> Kunal Agarwala

# Styles of Interview

There can be many different styles of interviews that match the formats of interviews.

## Competency Interview

These types of interviews require applicants to give specific encounters of times they have solved problems. They want to see you are compotent. This is where the _pre-project_ comes into play as well. What better way to prove you're good at something if you've actually done it?

## Strength Based Interviews

## Stress Based Interviews

## Technical Interviews

## Structured Interview

## Unstructured Interview

## Behavioral Interview

## Watching you on the job interview

## The case interview

## The Lunch interview

## Career Fair Interview

# numerical reasoning, verbal reasoning, and problem solving tests

# Preprojects

This is a project you take prior to working at the company. It's something that benefits them before you work for them.

Take for example this website: [Nina4AirBnB](http://www.nina4airbnb.com/).

This website lists all the things AirBnB are doing badly and talks about how they can improve. This even made it into National Newspapers:

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/airbnb-ceo-san-francisco-middle-east-travel-and-tourism-cv-linkedin-employment-a8158311.html

Because of this pre-project, she got an interview straight away:

![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*dzgczF9zljYaDwaGHq89Gg.png)

I know it takes time, research and dedication to do this but once you've done it you're almost guranteed an interview. What better way to show a company that you're hard working, dedicated to their cause and the company, and are a good researcher than to actually do a project like this?

Sure, you could say you are these things. But to go out of your way to do something for a company way before you even have an interview? That's something they'll love.

At YCombinator's Startup school they talk about how all employees must be passionate and dedicated to the business. It is rumoured that at Airbnb they ask the question "If you only have 1 year to live, would you still work here?" to see how passionate someone is about their cause.

Preprojects don't just work for tech, they can work for basically any business that has projects and all businesses have projects.

Let's say you want to work at an amusement park, like Dreamland or Thorpe Park. You can research and perhaps suggest an event for them or something along those lines. Like, hey, there's alot of this population in Margate (where Dreamland is) that don't fall into the demographiv "White - British". These people also celebrate this holiday on this day, maybe you should make an event out of it at Dreamland?
