Tim sort is a sorting algorithm created by Tim Peters for the Python programming language. It is a mixture of merge-sort and insertion sort, designed to work well on many real world problems instead of the purely academic problems proposed by previous sorting algorithms.

Since the algorithm has been invented it has been used as the default sorting algorithm in Python, Java, the Android Platform, and in versions of GNU.
