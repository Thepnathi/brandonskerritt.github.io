# Chapter 1 - Introduction

My name's Brandon. Over the years I've worked with and received many job offers. My friend, Chris, has gotten 19 internships in his first year of University. 

Don't you look at other professionals your age and wish you know what they do? I know I did.

Knowledge should be free.

Getting a job is like fitting shapes. You have a cube, and you fit it into a square hole.

Getting a job is very similar. It's all about making yourself fit into as many holes as possible for the job. To make yourself seem perfect for the job.

Sure, you may not be. But the company doesn't want "kind of perfect", they want the best.
