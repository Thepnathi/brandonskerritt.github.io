# Origins

We know that there are roots for every polynomial however there are 'problem polynomials' such as:

$$ x^2 + 1 $$

$$ x^2 - 2x + 2 $$

$$ x^3 - 8 $$

There are problemmatic because they do not have **real-valued** roots. For the first two cases there are _no_ real roots at all.

The idea of complex numbers is to find a way to treat problem polynomials in an unproblematic way.

We know that $$x^2 + 1$$ has two roots so let's invent a name for these, $$\mathbb{i}$$ with  $$\mathbb{i}^2 = (-\mathbb{i})^2 = -1$$ then $$x=\mathbb{i}$$ and $$x=-\mathbb{i}$$ are the two roots.

# The Formal Definition of the set of complex numbers

The complex numbers are a set described by the symbol $$\mathbb{C}$$.

Given X and Y $$\in \mathbb{R}$$

The *imaginary* or *complex* number Z is $$x + \mathbb{i}y$$ where $$\mathbb{i} = \sqrt{-1}$$
