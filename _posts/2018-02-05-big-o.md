Big 0 notation is notation used to describe how efficient an algorithm is. It's incredibly important to know this since every major employer will question you on this.

Powers of n are called polynomial functions
powering by n are called exponential formulae and are larger than powers of n.

A hierarchy of functions exist:

1 | log | n, $$n^2$$, $$n^3$$ | $$2^n$$
