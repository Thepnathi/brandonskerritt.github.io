Big 0 notation is notation used to describe how efficient an algorithm is. It's incredibly important to know this since every major employer will question you on this.

A hierarchy of functions exist:

1 | log n| n, $$n^2$$, $$n^3$$ | $$2^n$$
--- | --- | --- | ---
Constant | Logarithm | Polynomial | Exponential

Where the further right they are, the the longer take it takes.

In Big O notation, we always use the *worst case* scenario.

## Drop the constants

If you have an algorithm described as O(2n), drop the 2 so it's just O(n).

## Drop the non-dominant terms
