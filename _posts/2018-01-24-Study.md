In lecture examples and problems
Writing clear notes after a lecture
Meeting up with a group to study / solve problem sets (tutorials)
Understanding the bigger picture, why something is useful
Whenever a tutorial has a question in it you found hard, add it to a word document or write it down on a bit of paper. This will be your "Questions I found hard sheet".
Make flashcards, use Leitner system. Short, sweet, simple. Doesn't matter if they're digital or not. Students who used digital flashcards have been shown to retain information longer although this is because the paper flashcards didn't use a system like Leitner system which all digital flashcards use by default.
Write cheatsheets for all the major topics you have covered
make sure you understand what is in the test and what isn't
Solve your "questions i found hard" closer to the test alongside any class tests you have
This is a STEM subject. In a BA subject you are expected to memorise key dates and quotes. In a STEM subject you are expected to *understand* information and use it accordingly.
Always ask questions in class. The more questions you ask in the class the less questions you'll ask a week before the exam.

Hey guys! So foundations tomorrow. Worrying, right? 

Here's my take on Question 4 of class test 2 (thanks James Litchfield and Jahan Ulhaque for the help)

Also here's some blog posts on what you need to learn for tomorrow (I'm updating them rn)

Binomial Expansion (Note: calculators are allowed in an exam. If you want to find coefficient x^6 in (1+x)^8 you can do "6 (shift-divide button) 8)

De Morgan's Laws and other propositional stuff

What I recommend you do:
First 2 tutorials (because proofs aren't covered in class tests) and the 2 class tests.

As always, I'll be hanging around all day if any of you need any help :) <3
