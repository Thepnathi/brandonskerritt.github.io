# Finding out the degree of a polynomial
Given the equation
$$x^2 - 3x + 2$$
 How do we work out the degree and coefficients of it?

Well, the degree is the largest power of X which does not have a coefficient of 0. A coefficient is the number at the front of an element in the polynomial. So
$$0^6$$
would not be okay but
$$1^6$$
 would be okay.

Something to note here is that $$x^2$$ is actually 
$$1x^2$$
but because 1 * x is just x we don't include the 1, but it counts in this equation.

So
$$x^2 - 3x + 2$$
has a degree of 2 (x^2) and has 3 coefficients (starting at 0)
$$c_2 = 1, c_1 = 3, c_0 = 2$$
So the coefficients are just the number parts.

Some things you need to watch out for:

$$x^-1 + x + 1 $$
is not a polynomial because powers of x must be whole numbers.

$$x^2 + x^2 + x + x + 1$$
is not a polynomial because the x's aren't combined.
$$x^2+x^2 = x^4$$
It has to be exactly one item per k.

## Working out the roots of a polynomial
You know in GCSE when you solved polynomials to get 2 numbers? Well, this is exactly the same.
