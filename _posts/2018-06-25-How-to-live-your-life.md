        ...
end
```
Which of the following is true:

a)  Too much information will probably be written to the screen to allow location of the bug.

## Answers
### Question 1

W(t - s, s) = W(10 - 3, 3) = W(7, 3) = {r, r, q} = {r, q}

### Question 2

The working set of a process is defined to be the set of resources (T, s) defined in the time interval [T, T+s].

W(3, 4) = W(3, 3 + 4) = W(3, 7) = {q, q, q, p} = {q, p} 

### Question 3 
Answer: c
* Runs sequentially. A has to finish running before B starts
* With multiprogramming, I/O for one process can take pave whilst the computation takes place for another. Therefore 3 is true

### Question 4
Answer: d
Only one program (ls) is involved, but this will be run as two pocesses.

### Question 5
Answer: b
The shell calls fork(); the child process calls exec() and the parent calls wait(). The shell is just another process that can take a string as standard input, look for the program referenced by the string, and then run this program. Unless the program is put in the background, the shell will wait until the program has finished.

### Question 6 
Answer: c
The parent process will be moved back to the ready state (depending on the scheduling policy), and once the child has been admitted, will also be placed in the ready state

### Question 7 
Answer: d
Blocked; it may take some time before the file system can read the file (e.g. on a networked file store), so the process is blocked until the data is available.

### Question 8 
Answer: c
Only line 10 will be passed to wc -w

### Question 9
Answer: a
u*t; a/2; and t*t ‚Äì i.e. only those parts of the formula that have no dependencies on other parts of the formula can be run concurrently. Think how the formula could be written in 3-code...

### Question 10 
Answer: a
Every Java program starts as a thread! The rest of the statements are true...

### Question 11
Answer: b
If T1 executes first, then it acquires the semaphore, which is immediately released by T2. Both then execute the critical region.
If T2 executes first, it releases a semaphore it does not have, which can be acquired by T1. Again, both can execute the critical region.

### Question 12 

We have to ensure the following (problems with synchronsization):
‚Äì  producer cannot put items in buffer if it is full
‚Äì  consumer cannot extract items from buffer if it is empty
‚Äì  buffer is not accessed by two threads simultaneously 

### Question 13

*  Two threads can still access the buffer simultaneously ‚Äì there is nothing to stop this
* Note: The problem gets even worse when there are several consumers and producers

### Question 14
* Deadlock can arise
* If the consumer tries to remove an item from an empty buffer, it will *ve to wait for the buffer to be filled by the producer
* But the buffer will not be filled as the consumer has the lock
* Similarly for the producer

### Question1 15 
Answer: e
I, II and III ‚Äì as all three options will avoid exclusive ownership of the resources.

### Question 16
*  P2 with CPU burst of 5 milliseconds
*  P3 with CPU burst of 1 millisecond
*  P1 with CPU burst of 13 milliseconds
 Thus, the average wait time will be (0 + 5 + 6)/3 = 3.7 milliseconds

### Question 17
(0 + 5 + 14 + 20)/4 = 9.75 milliseconds

### Question 18
Answer: a
Round Robin ‚Äì this gives all processes equal access to the processor. The other techniques each select some ‚Äútypes‚Äù of processes to others (e.g. short processes, high priority processes etc).

### Question 19
It will favour the I/O-bound programs because of their relatively short CPU burst times but, the CPU-bound programs will not starve because the I/O-bound programs will relinquish the CPU relatively often to do their I/O.

### Question 20
* p1 - 8ms priority 2
* p2 - 2ms priority 1
* p3 - 5ms priority 3
* p4 - 4ms priority 2
 Average waiting time is (11 + 0 + 6 + 2)/4 = 4.75 milliseconds

### Question 21 
Answer: e
If we are avoiding the starvation of the 300K program, then we need to wait for an adjacent partition to become available to allow for the 300K program to run

### Question 22
Answer: e
First Fit would select 240K
Best Fit would select 108K
Worst Fit would select 600K
... as none of these select the 150K partition, then some other strategy has been used!

### Question 23
Answer: b
5600 (from segment 1) + 135 (offset)

### Question 24
Answer: c
I and II ‚Äì as the segment is shared, both processes need to index it (i.e. include an entry in their respective segment tables, and, the code must not be changed by its use (i.e. it should be re-entrant). Recursion is irrelevant to this issue.

### Question 25
Answer: d
Because it simplifies indexing of the page table and the calculation of the page offset.

### Question 26 
Answer: c
128; 9 bits are used for addressing the 512 bytes in each page, so the remaining 7 bits are used to address the pages

### Question 27
Answer: d
2048 (from page 1) + 352 (offset)

### Question 28
Answer: c
I and III only

### Question 29
Answer: e
I, II and III

### Question 30 
Answer: a
Linked is slower for both sequential and direct access

### Question 31
Answer: a
When there are multiple links to it.

### Question 32
Answer: e
The buffers may not be flushed, and the program may continue (and crash) giving misleading information.

### Question 33
Answer: b
11 ‚Äì as there are log2N-1 comparisons on average

### Question 34
Answer: b
Direct Lookup

### Question 35
Answer:d
No string derived from S has four consecutive b‚Äôs

### Question 36
Answer: c
A dynamic semantic error ‚Äì the value of a would cause an array out of bounds error

### Question 37
Answer: a
A syntax error ‚Äì all the tokens are valid, but the close parenthesis is missing, resulting in an error in the grammar

### Question 38
Answer: d
ab*cd/-

### Question 39
Answer: c
A context-free grammar defines the language used by the compiler; the rest are intermediate representations

### Question 40
Answer: d
Both expressions can be reduced by changing the operator: a = b ^ 2 can be reduced to a = b * b
a = a / 2 is a right shift operation: a = a >> 1

### Question 41
Answer: c
I and II only; recursion does not affect the size of data frames

### Question 42
Answer: b
A heap area

### Question 43
Answer: a
Lex is responsible for identifying tokens using regular expressions. It is therefore a scanner generator
