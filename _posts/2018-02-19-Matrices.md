A matrix is a container which can have many dimensions. Paul said that this won't be on the *first class test* but he might ask you to multiply matrices out.

We can represent a shape by representing its "corners" in a vector like so:

$$ <(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3), (x_4, y_4)>$$

If we wanted to scale this shape by a factor of s, we can use this matrix:

$$\begin{pmatrix}s & 0\\\ 0 & s\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}y_i \\\ x_i\end{pmatrix}$$

So you have a vector, which can be represented as a matrix. Just to drive the point home:

$$<x_1, y_1> = \begin{pmatrix}x_1 & y_1 \end{pmatrix}$$

This is just one corner, we obviously scale every corner by the scalar but we start with one corner and work our way through all the corners.

$$\begin{pmatrix}s & 0 & 0\\\ 0 & s & 0 \\\ 0 & 0 & s \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}y_i \\\ x_i \\\ z_i \end{pmatrix}$$
