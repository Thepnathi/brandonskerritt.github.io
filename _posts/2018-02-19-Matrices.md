A matrix is a container which can have many dimensions. Paul said that this won't be on the *first class test* but he might ask you to multiply matrices out.

We can represent a shape by representing its "corners" in a vector like so:

$$ <(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3), (x_4, y_4)>$$

If we wanted to scale this shape by a factor of s, we can use this matrix:

$$\begin{pmatrix}s & 0\\\ 0 & s\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}y_i \\\ x_i\end{pmatrix}$$

So you have a vector, which can be represented as a matrix. Just to drive the point home:

$$<x_1, y_1> = \begin{pmatrix}x_1 & y_1 \end{pmatrix}$$

This is just one corner, we obviously scale every corner by the scalar but we start with one corner and work our way through all the corners.

$$\begin{pmatrix}s & 0 & 0\\\ 0 & s & 0 \\\ 0 & 0 & s \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}y_i \\\ x_i \\\ z_i \end{pmatrix}$$

The matrix applied to scale the vector is an example of a *linear transformation*.

An operation, T, is a _*linear transformation*_ if:
1. For any pair of vectors, v and u, belonging to the vector space, V:
  T(v + u) = T(v) + T(u)
2. For every vector in V and any r (real number) in the set used by R (natural numbers, real, rational):
  T(rv) = rT(v)

What if we wanted to move a point, say <1, 2> to <5, 6>?

Well, this is easy!

$$\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 4 \\\ 0 & 1 & 4 \\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}y_i \\\ 4 \\\ 4 \\\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}5 \\\ 6 \\\ 1 \end{pmatrix} $$

We can generalise this like so:

Say you want to move a point <x, y> to the point <x + p, y + q>

$$\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & p \\\ 0 & 1 & q \\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}y_i \\\ x \\\ y \\\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}5 \\\ 6 \\\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

What if we wanted to rotate a a point anticlockwise about <0, 0> by theta to <q, s>?
