# What is Tor?

The Onion Routing Protocol (TOR) was designed by the US Navy in the mid 1990s at the U.S Naval Research Labatory[0].

The pre-alpha version of Tor was released to the public in September of 2002 [1] and the Tor project, the company that maintains Tor, was started in 2006.

Here is a quote from the paper titled "Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router" on what Tor is in a nutshell:

> Tor is a circuit based low-latency anonymous communication service [2]

The core principle of Tor is "onion routing" which is a technique for anonymous communication over a public network. In onion routing messages are encapsulated in several layers of encryption, analgous to encapsulation in the OSI 7 layer model [3]. It is called onion routing because onions have layers and this networking protocol also has layers.

The resulting 'onion' (fully encapsulated message) is then transmitted through a series of nodes in a network (called onion routers) with each node peeling away a layer of the 'onion' and therefore uncovering the data's next destination. When the final layer is decrypted you get the plaintext of the original message.

The original author remains anonymous because each node in the network is only aware of the preceeding and following nodes in the path (except the first node that does know who the sender is, but doesn't know the final destination).

This has led to 'attacks' on which the NSA runs servers in order to attempt to be the first and last nodes in the network. If the NSA server is the first node, it knows the message. If the NSA server is the last node, it knows the final destination. [4]

## Overview

> Onion Routing is a distributied overlay network designed to anonymise TCP-based applications like web browsing, secure shell and instant messaging.

Clients *choose* a path through the network and build a _circuit_ where each onion router in the paths knows the predecessor and the successor, but no other nodes in the circuit. 

Packets flows down the network in fixed-size cells (think packets) which are unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node and relayed downstream.

The notion of a symetric key comes from Symmetric-Key Encryption Algorithms.

### Symmetric-Key Encryption Algorithms, a detour
In Symmetric Key Encryption the same key is used for both Alice (sender) and Bob (receiver) as opposed to public key encryption where these keys differ.
