# What is Tor?

The Onion Routing Protocol (TOR) was designed by the US Navy in the mid 1990s at the U.S Naval Research Labatory[0].

The pre-alpha version of Tor was released to the public in September of 2002 [1] and the Tor project, the company that maintains Tor, was started in 2006.

Here is a quote from the paper titled "Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router" on what Tor is in a nutshell:

> Tor is a circuit based low-latency anonymous communication service [2]

The core principle of Tor is "onion routing" which is a technique for anonymous communication over a public network. In onion routing messages are encapsulated in several layers of encryption, analogous to encapsulation in the OSI 7 layer model [3]. It is called onion routing because onions have layers and this networking protocol also has layers.

The resulting 'onion' (fully encapsulated message) is then transmitted through a series of nodes in a network (called onion routers) with each node peeling away a layer of the 'onion' and therefore uncovering the data's next destination. When the final layer is decrypted you get the plaintext of the original message.

The original author remains anonymous because each node in the network is only aware of the preceding and following nodes in the path (except the first node that does know who the sender is, but doesn't know the final destination).

This has led to 'attacks' on which the NSA runs servers in order to attempt to be the first and last nodes in the network. If the NSA server is the first node, it knows where the message is from. If the NSA server is the last node, it knows the final destination and what the message says. [4]

## Overview

> Onion Routing is a distributed overlay network designed to anonymise TCP-based applications like web browsing, secure shell and instant messaging.

Clients *choose* a path through the network and build a _circuit_ where each onion router in the paths knows the predecessor and the successor, but no other nodes in the circuit. 

Packets flows down the network in fixed-size cells (think packets) which are unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node and relayed downstream.

The notion of a symmetric key comes from Symmetric-Key Encryption Algorithms.

### Symmetric-Key Encryption Algorithms, a detour
In Symmetric Key Encryption the same key is used for both Alice (sender) and Bob (receiver) as opposed to public key encryption where these keys differ.
This makes it faster and easier to use than Public Key encryption, but this also causes two problems:
* The key needs to be stored securely
* Transfer of key may not be secured.

If a third party figures out the key, either by attacking the transfer of the key or some other method they will be able to decrypt all communications encrypted with this key.

Symmetric Key encryption is also much less computationally expensive than public key encryption, which is useful in a network like this.

*Public Key Cryptography* is a set of cryptographic protocols based on algorithms that require two separate keys:
* Public-key - Which is public and visible by others
* Private-key - Which is private and meant to be kept secret.

These two keys are mathematically linked. In public key cryptography the use of the public key is use encrypt plaintext and the use of the private key is to decrypt encrypted text. This means that anyone can encrypt plaintext for a specific person but only that person can decrypt it.

The two keys are very large prime numbers. Assume q and p are two separate and equally large prime numbers and then n = pq. n is used to encrypt the message and p and q are used to decrypt the message.

This works because factorisation is hard to compute. Given a very (very) large number, find the factors of that number which are prime numbers.

Often times the numbers are in hexadecimal.

### Digital Signatures

Another useful tool of cryptography to know is digital signatures.

Digital Signatures use public-key cryptography. A digital signature is a digital version of a physical signature. Often times you can say you have cryptographically / digitally signed a document. Only the person with the private key can produce valid digital signatures which allow them to sign a document alot more securely than a physical written signature.

Alice wants to digitally sign a message, m. In order to do that Alice must have:

* Private-key (signing key) - $$ Key_(private) $$
* Public-key (verification key) - $$ Key_(public) $$

Alice then uses a signing function to produce a digital signature:
$$ signing(message,KEY_(private))→signature $$

The _exact_ internals of the signing function isn't necessary to know. The function takes a message, a private key and it will produce a digital signature.

Anyone can use the public key to verify a digital signature:

$$ verify(m,signature,KEY_(public))→\true\ \or\ \false $$

I say that a signing function isn't necessary to know however if you want to learn a few go ahead. The reason I haven't added them to this document is because someone from 2 - 3 years time might read this and signing functions could be completely different.

## Tor itself

Tor requires alot of users to create anonmity and thus if Tor was hard to use users wouldn't adopt it so easily making it less anonymous. Because of this, the usabillity isn't just a design choice of Tor but a *security requirement*. If Tor isn't usable or designed nicely, it won't be used and thus it won't be secured.

Tor has therefore had to make some design decisions that may not improve security but improve usabillity.

## Disadvantages

Tor is not a completely decentralised peer-to-peer system like many people believe it to be. If it was completely peer to peer it wouldn't be very usable. Tor requires a set of directory servers that manage and keep the state of the network at any given time.

Tor is not secure against end to end attacks. An end to end attack is where an entity (Alice) has control of both the first and last node in a path, as stated earlier. This is a problem that cyber security experts have yet to solve, so Tor does not have a solution to this problem.

Tor does not provide protocol-normalisation like Privoxy or the Anonymizer, meaning that If senders want anonymity from responders while using complex and variable protocols like HTTP, Tor must be layered with a ﬁltering proxy such as Privoxy to hide differences between clients, and expunge protocol features that leak identity. [2]

Tor does not hide the identity of the sender.

In 2013 during the Final Exams period at Harvard a student tried to delay the exam by sending in a fake bomb threat. The student used Tor and Guerillar Mail (a service which allows people to make disposable email addresses) to send the bomb threat to school officials.  [5]

The student was caught, even though he took precautions to make sure he wasn't caught.

Gurillar mail sends an originating IP address header along with the email that's sent so the receiver knows where the original email came from. With Tor, the student expected the IP address to be scrambled but the authorities knew it came from a Tor exit node (Tor keeps a list of all nodes in the directory service) so the authoriies simply looked for people who were accessing Tor at the time the email was sent.

## Onion Routing

So given the network above we are going to simulate a very basic onion routing protocol. The laptop on the left is the sender and the server rack on the right is the receiver.

![img](https://screenshotscdn.firefoxusercontent.com/images/868d4471-85ae-4954-a7e1-e4fde7a4ed25.png)
So we start off by encrypting a message with 3 layers of encryption (Tor typically uses 3 nodes, so therefore 3 layers of encryption are needed)

![img](https://screenshotscdn.firefoxusercontent.com/images/47c173ca-dd22-4760-896f-8a143aef69da.png)
The first layer is stripped off on the first machine. Something important to note here is that every machine only knows what the predecessor is or what the sucessor is, it does not know what the final goal is unless it is the last node in the path.

![img](https://screenshotscdn.firefoxusercontent.com/images/c9e3accb-d03d-417b-993a-460849ac8a49.png)
As it travels down the path, more and more layers are stripped away. The second (middle) node does not know where the message originated or where the final destination is.

![img](https://screenshotscdn.firefoxusercontent.com/images/15ff87be-2008-41f3-ad34-d5a02ab056bf.png)
The final node knows what the message is and where it's going, but it doesn't know who sent it.

The computer then reads the content of the message which might be "connect me to Facebook" and it then connects to Facebook and receives a message back as a response. Because the node doesn't know where the original message came from, it sends it back through the network to the predecessor and says "pass this back through the network".

But before doing this, it adds it's own level of encryption back. 

![img](https://screenshotscdn.firefoxusercontent.com/images/6ade76ec-2737-4663-9d7b-0a5f9097ff70.png)

![img](https://screenshotscdn.firefoxusercontent.com/images/36b22a1f-70d2-4d20-a2d3-1bcfcf42dda7.png)

Eventually the original node receives a fully encrypted packet containing the response from Facebook. Because the original node has both private and public keys it can fully decrypt the message.

![img](https://screenshotscdn.firefoxusercontent.com/images/9611b45d-ec31-40ad-92de-12a50e7b0d9b.png)

One of the key properties here is that once a node decrypts a layer, it cannot tell how many more layers there are to decrypt. It could be as small as 1 or 2 or as large as 200 layers of encryption.

The first node knows who sent the message but it doesn't know what the message says because it is encrypted. The last node knows what the message says but it can't tell where it came from.
