# Question 4

Consider the following psuedo code to search if a value _key_ is in a linked list and an instance of the linked list. What is being output at the end of the code if _key_ is:
1. 25
2. 40

```
node ← head, found ← false
while node != NIL and found != true do
begin
    if node.data == key then
        found ← true
    node ← node.next
end
if found == true then
    output "FOUND!"
else output "NOT FOUND!"
```
