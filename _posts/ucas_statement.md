To me, Computer Science is the beautiful art of solving complex problems with logical and
abstract solutions. Computers are used almost everywhere and with the Internet of Things on
the rise I love to look at cities and understand that everything from the lights to the design
of road networks is computer based. To know more about this connected world we live in seems
essential, which is why I have chosen this course.
 
Upon studying Alan Turing's "On Computable Numbers, with an application to the
Entscheidungsproblem" I gained a deeper interest in the theory of automata and the limitations
of computing. What especially interested me is the Halting Problem because not only did Turing
prove the problem through contradiction, which is fascinating, but the fact that this found so
often in real life, for instance in writing a compiler to make code execute.
 
Alan Turing inspired me to write a decryption program for Geocachers; one that can decrypt any
basic encryption with only 1 input and 1 output, much like the abstraction so often seen in
today's computing world. This program allowed me to work within teams and help me understand
user experience design. Furthermore, it allowed me to learn about different computational
fields such as Information Theory and Testing. I have taken the lessons I've learned from this
program to create applications for volunteer-based startups such as Project Meetup; a business
aimed at connecting programmers together.
 
My current course has really helped me understand that computing is pervasive and relevant
everywhere. Object Orientated Design is found so often in life and everything can be seen as
an object. We can apply logic from Object Orientated Design to everyday situations such as
inheritance, classes or polymorphism within such simple objects like doors. The extra-circular
courses which I undertook such as Harvard's CS50 or Introduction to Linux by the Linux
Foundation have helped my progression in creating formal assignments and self-studying
computer systems. My favourite topic is security and how the internet was designed upon a
model of "trusted computers" which is why the internet is fundamentally insecure. To further
my knowledge, I attended Harvard's CS50 Hackathon where we tackled CS50 problem sets and met
the teaching staff. I have also attended other Hackathons around the UK to create intriguing
projects and learn more about computing within industry. At one hackathon, my team and I won a
prize for best use of Amazon Web Services.
 
The Gold Duke of Edinburgh Award has provided me with the opportunity to study British Sign
Language which has helped me understand and interact with the local deaf community. For my
DofE I also worked at and with many charities to support my community. I set up a programming
club called Free Code Camp Kent which allows me to lead and mentor people who want to learn to
code. As a STEM Ambassador, I regularly visit schools to teach about STEM. This has helped me
understand how STEM is perceived in our world while making some great friends and it has
enabled me to learn a range of valuable personal development skills, such as teamwork,
communication, and time management. As well as being a student ambassador for my college, I
have been elected as the Higher Education Officer by my peers and
it has allowed me to make a difference at my college by attending National Union of Students
meetings to make sure that everyone has an equal chance to succeed in Higher Education.
 
I look forward to the challenges that studying at university will bring me as well as the
satisfying opportunities to learn more.
