# Brandon Skerritt
# HSC Plan for End of Year


<!-- @import "[TOC]" {cmd="toc" depthFrom=1 depthTo=6 orderedList=false} -->


# Plan A

## Where

Carnibar

## When
1 week before / after the Mcnair end of year event

## Features

- Ticketed
The event should be ticketed as the rule of scarcity implies that events that appear "exclusive" are more likely to have customers. One of the downsides of this is the distrubtion and production of the tickets.

- Free drink
The offer of a free item such as an alcoholic beverage will entice more people to come. One of the larger downsides for this is that it will cost money. One could reduce the cost of drinks in Carnibar which will save us money and entice people to buy alcohol, but this isn't as enticing as a free drink offer.

- DJ
A live band typically hasn't gone down as well as a DJ has in the past. The downside to this is that the DJ might not play songs everyone likes. There's a rule in thermodynamic design of buildings that when creating the "perfect temperture" you don't want to find a tempterue level that *everyone* likes but you want to find the temperture that the least amount of people hate. 

This rule can be applied to the music selection at this event. People **could** use the sound system, however this would likely result in people playing 'crap' music and encouraging customers to leave.

- Theme

The event may be themed, depdending on the input of the others in LMH / Morton. This may discourage some people from coming.

- Photobooth

The photobooth was amazing and clearly one of the most popular attractions at the formals. Why get rid of something that's extremely popular?

The photobooth will allow people to create long-lasting memories in polaroid format from this wonderful event.

# End of year for HSC

I suggest that the HSC have a meal out as a final goodbye.
